This article offers a comparative analysis of commercial and social entrepreneurship using a prevailing analytical model from commercial entrepreneurship. The analysis highlights key similarities and differences between these two forms of entrepreneurship and presents a framework on how to approach the social entrepreneurial process more systematically and effectively. We explore the implications of this analysis of social entrepreneurship for both practitioners and researchers. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

This article puts forward a view of social entrepreneurship as a process that catalyzes social change and addresses important social needs in a way that is not dominated by direct financial benefits for the entrepreneurs. Social entrepreneurship is seen as differing from other forms of entrepreneurship in the relatively higher priority given to promoting social value and development versus capturing economic value. To stimulate future research the authors introduce the concept of embeddedness as a nexus between theoretical perspectives for the study of social entrepreneurship. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The paper concludes with the proposal of a suitably flexible explication of the concept: social entrepreneurship is exercised where some person or persons (1) aim either exclusively or in some prominent way to create social value of some kind, and pursue that goal through some combination of (2) recognizing and exploiting opportunities to create this value, (3) employing innovation, (4) tolerating risk and (5) declining to accept limitations in available resources. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

One social entrepreneur, Ibrahim Abouleish, recently received the "Alternative Nobel Prize" for his Sekem initiative; in 2004, e-Bay founder Jeff Skoll donated 4.4 million pounds to set up a social entrepreneurship research center; and many social entrepreneurs have mingled with their business counterparts at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Social entrepreneurship offers insights that may stimulate ideas for more socially acceptable and sustainable business strategies and organizational forms. Because it contributes directly to internationally recognized sustainable development (SD) goals, social entrepreneurship may also encourage established corporations to take on greater social responsibility. © 2004 Kelly School of Business, Indiana University.

We argue that one important way that new organizational forms emerge is through a process of bridging institutional entrepreneurship, which involves an institutional entrepreneur combining aspects of established institutional logics to create a new type of organization underpinned by a new, hybrid logic. Building on an in-depth case study of a social enterprise in the United Kingdom, we present a model of the institutional work required for this type of institutional entrepreneurship. The model highlights the multilevel nature of bridging institutional entrepreneurship, showing that it entails institutional work at the micro-, meso-, and macrolevels. The study contributes to the literature by examining an important way that institutional entrepreneurs create new organizational forms; shedding light on the relationship between individual, organizational, and societal level institutional processes; and exploring the relationship between entrepreneurship and institutional entrepreneurship. © 2011 INFORMS.},

This analysis suggests that the dominant discourses of social entrepreneurship represent legitimating material for resource-rich actors in a process of reflexive isomorphism.

abstract={Social entrepreneurship has recently received greater recognition from the public sector, as well as from scholars. However, the lack of a unifying paradigm in the field has lead to a proliferation of definitions. Moreover, several approaches of the phenomenon, as well as different schools of thought, have emerged in different regions of the world. At first glance, because of different conceptions of capitalism and of the government's role, there seems to be a difference between the American and the European conceptions of social entrepreneurship. The objective of this paper is to clarify the concepts of 'social entrepreneurship', 'social entrepreneur' and 'social entrepreneurship organization' and to examine whether there is a transatlantic divide in the way these are conceived and defined. After having justified the need for a definition, we present the different geographical perspectives. North American and European literatures on social entrepreneurship are critically analysed by means of Gartner's four differentiating aspects: the individual, the process, the organization and the environment. We show that there is no clear-cut transatlantic divide, but that, even within the US, different conceptions coexist. We propose definitions for the main concepts associated with social entrepreneurship and, finally, discuss implications for future research. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={In a world filled with poverty, environmental degradation, and moral injustice, social enterprises offer a ray of hope. These organizations seek to achieve social missions through business ventures. Yet social missions and business ventures are associated with divergent goals, values, norms, and identities. Attending to them simultaneously creates tensions, competing demands, and ethical dilemmas. Effectively understanding social enterprises therefore depends on insight into the nature and management of these tensions. While existing research recognizes tensions between social missions and business ventures, we lack any systematic analysis. Our paper addresses this issue. We first categorize the types of tensions that arise between social missions and business ventures, emphasizing their prevalence and variety. We then explore how four different organizational theories offer insight into these tensions, and we develop an agenda for future research. We end by arguing that a focus on social-business tensions not only expands insight into social enterprises, but also provides an opportunity for research on social enterprises to inform traditional organizational theories. Taken together, our analysis of tensions in social enterprises integrates and seeks to energize research on this expanding phenomenon. ©2013 Business Ethics Quarterly.},

abstract={Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to address the emerging practice of social entrepreneurship by exploring the historical and theoretical antecedents of social enterprise and its contemporary practice. By exploring key theoretical concepts, the paper draws comparisons between "for-profit" and social entrepreneurs. The paper seeks to discuss the contemporary practice of social entrepreneurship. Discussion of the theory of entrepreneurship and contemporary practice of social entrepreneurs seeks to create a more nuanced view of social entrepreneurship and develop greater theoretical insights into this phenomenon and its recent expansion. Design/methodology/approach - A phenomenological research approach was adopted, and 80 in-depth interviews with social entrepreneurs from across the UK identified as the most appropriate data collection tool. Data analysis sought to identify and understand similarities between the more understood and studied behaviour of "profit-seeking" entrepreneurs and those of an emerging group of social entrepreneurs. Findings - In-depth interviews revealed five key themes within which the practice of social entrepreneurship could be compared and contrasted with for-profit entrepreneurship. These included: the entrepreneurial process, in particular, opportunity recognition; network embeddedness; the nature of financial risk and profit; the role of individual versus collective action in managing and structuring enterprises; and creativity and innovation. Practical implications - Findings suggest that while the contemporary practices of social enterprises share many similarities with their for-profit counterparts, significant differences can be found when comparing these practices with extant entrepreneurship research. Originality/value - The paper addresses an emerging phenomenon within the practice and theory of entrepreneurship and offers insight into similarities and differences between entrepreneurship in the profit and not-for-profit sectors.},

abstract={The term "social entrepreneurship" is being adopted and used more extensively, but its meaning is not widely understood. In particular, the scope of social entrepreneurship in both business and the voluntary sector has not been mapped effectively. This paper seeks to do this. It begins by defining social entrepreneurs and social entrepreneurship. Then, using projects considered for a charter award under the Duke of York's Community Initiative, it looks at what social entrepreneurs do and achieve for the community, at the wide scope of their world, and at the help that is available and needed. The paper includes two case studies of successful social entrepreneurs as a means of drawing out a number of important issues and lessons. It provides a new map for understanding the complexity and the many facets of the world of the social entrepreneur and the voluntary sector. It questions whether the UK government's stated desire for an "explosive act" of volunteering can happen without more substantial support, and concludes that whilst the growth of this sector is urgent and vital, a number of hurdles remain to be overcome.},

abstract={The sheer impact of the recent global financial turmoil and scandals (such as Enron and WorldCom) has demonstrated that unbridled commercial entrepreneurs who are allowed to pursue their short-term opportunities regardless of the consequences has led to a massive depreciation of the wealth of nations, social livelihood and environmental degradation. This article suggests that the time has come for entrepreneurs to adopt a more integrative view of business that blends economic, social and environmental values. Social entrepreneurs present such a proposition through their deep commitment towards the social vision, appreciation of sustainable practices, innovativeness, ability to build social networks and also generate viable financial returns. It could be expected that social entrepreneurs often possess certain distinct personality characteristics which define their behaviours/actions. Personality traits are partly developed by innate nurturing, socialization and education. These tacit traits are also formed values/beliefs held and play an important role in driving social entrepreneurial decision making. Thus, personality traits may influence the intentions and the manner in which the individual acts. We hold that if social entrepreneurship is to be effective and impactful, business and management education can facilitate the development of these critical personality traits. Thus, this study primes at determining the personality traits that influence social entrepreneurs' start-up intentions. It also reinforces the findings that personality traits do influence entrepreneurship in general. This study examines the influence of the Big Five personality traits on social entrepreneurship dimensions. The findings reveal that agreeableness positively influences all dimensions of social entrepreneurship, whereas openness exerts a positive influence on social vision, innovation and financial returns. Methodologically, this study develops valid and reliable scales for social entrepreneurship and verifies the adopted Big Five personality measure of Schmit et al. (Pers Psychol 53:153-193, 2000) using the five-point Likert scale. The implication of this study is that element of appreciation of social responsibility, sustainability and character development needs to be integrated within the business education curriculum to support social entrepreneurs in realizing genuine value and impact to the causes and communities they serve. Future business leaders also need to be equipped with entrepreneurship skills, while exuding independent and reflective thinking in the pursuit life-long learning. The originality of this study lies in its focus on personality traits on social rather than commercial entrepreneurship. It is hoped that the findings will trigger a paradigm shift towards greater social entrepreneurship through education by nurturing sustainable development values in future business graduates. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={While the adoption of Social Innovation (SI) in the governance and policy domain has fueled a rapidly expanding scholarly literature, this field has become characterized by conceptual ambiguity and a diversity of definitions and research settings. This present situation inhibits the integration of findings. This paper traces the content, scope and relatively short history of modern social innovation research across disciplines by applying network and bibliometric analyses, and explores their relevance to innovation studies. Based on data from 172 publications, we analyze scholarly works that directly address the social innovation topic, allowing us to identify the precedence, dynamics and the current map of social innovation research as an emerging field of study. Our analysis suggests that the SI field is grounded in four distinct intellectual communities arising through a somewhat organized diffusion process: 1) Community Psychology; 2) Creativity research; 3) Social and societal challenges; 4) Local development. The interest of SI in the areas of management and entrepreneurship is only very recent and is currently reflected within existing communities. We forge conceptual bridges between the two (currently very separate) domains of social innovation and innovation studies, and the implications of our finding for further research and policy are also discussed. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

However, the field remains hard to grasp in its entirety, as researchers use a multitude of similar, yet distinct, key concepts. The considerable range and complexity of these overlapping notions create major challenges: Scholars struggle to position their work in a larger context; it is not easy to build on previous findings and methodological developments; and research gaps are difficult to identify. The present article presents the first systematic literature review to confront those challenges by reviewing 599 relevant sources. In a first step, various key concepts are clarified. Second, the field is mapped according to three research foci: causes of NPOs becoming business-like, organizational structures and processes of becoming business-like, and effects of becoming business-like. From this, we draw conclusions and make suggestions for further research. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.},

abstract={Social entrepreneurship has emerged as an active area of practice and research within the last three decades. Nevertheless, in spite of its growing popularity, scholars and practitioners are far from reaching a consensus as to what social entrepreneurship actually means. This has resulted in a number of different definitions and approaches within the field of social entrepreneurship. The purpose of this article is to shed light on the ongoing contestation of social entrepreneurship and to offer a novel conceptual understanding of the concept that can facilitate the development of systematic and structured future research. To this end, we analyze social entrepreneurship on the basis of the theory of essentially contested concepts, which was proposed by Walter Bryce Gallie in 1956. Building upon this theory, this article shows that social entrepreneurship can be regarded as an essentially contested concept and that a universal definition that would be accepted among contestant parties is hardly possible. Responding to this recognition, the article proposes the conceptualization of social entrepreneurship as a cluster concept, which can serve as a conceptual tool to help advancing social entrepreneurship as a coherent field of research despite its contested nature. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={This paper presents an exploratory analysis of the emergent reporting practices used by social entrepreneurs in terms of their institutional settings and strategic objectives. These reporting practices not only account for financial performance but also disclose more nuanced and contingent social and environmental impacts and outcomes. Furthermore, they act as symbolic objects expressing the market orientation of many socially entrepreneurial organizations in that they aim to provide more complete and transparent disclosure of a variety of performance impacts. Conceptually, this paper draws upon approaches developed within the sociology of accounting as institutional practice and uses three theoretical interpretations to conceptualize the function and effects of reporting, disclosure, and audit in social entrepreneurship: positivist; critical theorist; and interpretative. A discussion of five case studies leads to the development of a new theoretical construct - 'Blended Value Accounting' - that constitutes a spectrum of disclosure logics used by social entrepreneurs to access resources and realize organizational mission objectives with key stakeholders. Conclusions consider some further questions around socially entrepreneurial reporting practices and strategies and suggest some new lines of research going forward. © 2009.},

abstract={Rooted in the notion of inclusive capitalism, the Bottom-of-the-Pyramid (BoP) approach argues for the simultaneous pursuit of profit and social welfare by creating markets for the poor. This idea has been both celebrated and criticized in the literature. We do neither in this paper. Instead, by leveraging insights from Amartya Sen's work on capability development and the literature on social capital, we offer a more socially embedded and community-centric BoP approach. By redefining poverty not just as a lack of income, but also as a lack of 'capabilities' in Sen's sense that can be developed through leveraging social capital, we offer a systemic framework for understanding the societal impact of business-driven ventures in the BoP and empowering BoP communities through these ventures. Specifically, we argue that any business initiative in the BoP ought to be evaluated on the basis of whether it advances capability transfer and retention by (a) enhancing the social capital between a particular community and other more resource rich networks, and (b) preserving the existing social capital in the community. © 2012 The Authors.

We propose that the country prevalence rate of social entrepreneurship is an indicator of constructible nation-level social capital and enhances the likelihood of individual commercial entry. We further posit that both social and commercial entrepreneurial entry is facilitated by certain formal institutions, namely strong property rights and (low) government activism, albeit the latter impacts each of these types of entrepreneurship differently. We apply bivariate discrete choice multilevel modeling to population-representative samples in 47 countries and find support for these hypotheses. © 2013 Baylor University.},

abstract={Corporate social responsibility (CSR) literature suggests CSR initiatives extend beyond meeting the immediate interests of stakeholders of for-profit enterprises, offering the potential to also enhance performance. Growing disillusionment of for-profit business models has drawn attention to social entrepreneurship and social innovation to ease social issues. Adopting a systematic review of relevant research, the article provides collective insights into research linking social innovation with social entrepreneurship, demonstrating growing interest in the area over the last decade. The past 5 years have seen a surge in attention with particular focus on the role of the entrepreneur, networks, systems, institutions, and cross-sectoral partnerships. Based on the findings of the review, the authors synthesize formerly dispersed fields of research into an analytical framework, signposting a “systems of innovation” approach for future studies of social innovation and social entrepreneurship. © The Author(s) 2014.},

abstract={This article explores the strategies and dynamics of scaling up social innovations. Social innovation is a complex process that profoundly changes the basic routines, resource and authority flows, or beliefs of the social system in which it occurs. Various applications of marketing and diffusion theory are helpful to some extent in understanding the trajectories or successful strategies associated with social innovation. It seems unwise, however, to rely solely on a market model to understand the dynamics of scaling social innovation, in view of the complex nature of the supply-demand relation with respect to the social innovation market. Instead, the authors propose a distinctive model of system transformation associated with a small but important group of social innovations and dependent on discontinuous and cross-scale change. This paper focuses on the challenge of scaling up social innovations in general and in particular the dynamics of going to scale.},

This has resulted in important insights concerning the role of SE in fostering inclusive growth and institutional change. However, the rapid growth of SE research, the emerging nature of the literature, and the fact that SE builds on different disciplines and fields (e.g., entrepreneurship, sociology, economics, ethics) have led to a rather fragmented literature without dominant frameworks. This situation risks leading to a duplication of efforts and hampers cumulative knowledge growth. Drawing on 395 peer-reviewed articles on SE, we (1) identify gaps in SE research on three levels of analysis (i.e., individual, organizational, institutional), (2) proffer an integrative multistage, multilevel framework, and (3) discuss promising avenues for further research on SE. © The Author(s) 2018.},

abstract={Many entrepreneurs are struggling with the question of how to deliver a successful fund-raising pitch on crowdfunding platforms. In this study, we focus on the linguistic style of crowdfunding pitches and how such a style relates to the success in raising funds. Based on the language expectancy theory, we hypothesize that the importance of linguistic style depends on whether an entrepreneur belongs to an emergent category of new ventures (social entrepreneurs) or to an established category (commercial entrepreneurs). In particular, social entrepreneurs need to compensate for their incomplete social categorization and the related ill-formed expectations by relying more extensively on linguistic style to attract funding. Empirical analyses of 656 Kickstarter campaigns demonstrate that linguistic styles that make the campaigns and their founders more understandable and relatable to the crowd boost the success of social campaigns, but hardly matter for commercial campaigns. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={NGDOs are the product of an era that is rapidly passing. Yet the common goals they strive towards remain relevant and are far from being realised. Poverty, inequity, insecurity and injustice were stubborn features of the old world order and are abiding features of the new. A brief history of NGDOs and of the radical shifts in the context where international development takes place shows that the goals NGDOs typically aspire to cannot be reached by simply relying on the framework employed by the official aid system. One important reason is that a growing reliance on tax-based funding is shifting NGDO morality, legitimacy and function from the civic to the public domain. Consequently, a new paradigm is required not just for NGDO development practice, but for the very nature of NGDOs themselves. This paper explores the extent to which social entrepreneurship and civic innovation could provide a new framework for NGDOs and development beyond aid. While both merit further attention, civic innovation is shown the better to fulfil the twin requirements of civic financial embedding allied to principles of co-operation and non-exploitation.},

abstract={A new challenge in executive education is to develop responsible global business leaders. We describe "Project Ulysses," an integrated service-learning program which involves sending participants in teams to developing countries to work in cross-sector partnerships with NGOs, social entrepreneurs, or international organizations. In order to understand how Ulysses participants learn from their experiences while abroad, we interviewed 70 participants and content-analyzed the learning narratives that they produced. We found evidence of learning in six areas: responsible mind-set, ethical literacy, cultural intelligence, global mind-set, self-development, and community building. We also identified a number of processes through which learning occurred at the cognitive, affective, and behavioral levels, including the process of resolving cultural and ethical paradoxes; constructing a new lifeworld, that is, developing a new perspective of self and the world; and making sense of the emotions experienced while on assignment. The results of a postprogram survey confirm the long-term effectiveness of Ulysses in developing and enhancing competencies that are critical for responsible global leadership. We discuss the implications for theory building on responsible leadership and helping organizations leverage the potential of international servicelearning programs for developing responsible global leaders. © 2011 Academy of Management Learning & Education.},

Yet because social enterprises integrate social welfare and commercial logics, they face the challenge of pursuing frequently conflicting goals. Studies have begun to address how established social enterprises can manage these tensions, but we know little about how, why, and with what consequences social entrepreneurs mix competing logics as they create new organizations. To address this gap, we develop a theoretical model based in identity theory that helps to explain (1) how commercial and social welfare logics become relevant to entrepreneurship, (2) how different types of entrepreneurs perceive the tension between these logics, and (3) what implications this has for how entrepreneurs recognize and develop social enterprise opportunities. Our approach responds to calls from organizational and entrepreneurship scholars to extend existing frameworks of opportunity recognition and development to better account for social enterprise creation. © Academy of Management Review.},

abstract={Complex challenges demand complex solutions. By their very nature, these problems are difficult to define and are often the result of rigid social structures that effectively act as "traps". However, resilience theory and the adaptive cycle can serve as a useful framework for understanding how humans may move beyond these traps and towards the social innovation that is required to address many complex problems. This paper explores the critical question of whether networks help facilitate innovations to bridge the seemingly insurmountable chasms of complex problems to create change across scales, thereby increasing resilience. The argument is made that research has not yet adequately articulated the strategic agency that must be present within the network in order for cross scale interactions to occur. By examining institutional entrepreneurship through case studies and examples, this paper proposes that agency within networks requires specific skills from entrepreneurs, including ones that enable pattern generation, relationship building and brokering, knowledge and resource brokering, and network recharging. Ultimately, this begins to build a more complete understanding of how networks may improve human capacity to respond to complex problems and heighten overall resilience. © 2011 by the author(s).},

We study two processes of resource mobilization-optimization and bricolage, and examine the antecedent conditions that influence a venture's selection of these processes. Our theory predicts that environmental munificence and organizational prominence have U-shaped associations with the use of bricolage and positive associations with the use of optimization.

abstract={Research generally suggests that, relative to commercial entrepreneurs, social entrepreneurs stand at a disadvantage at acquiring resources through traditional financial institutions. Yet interest in social entrepreneurship appears to be at an all-time high. The current paper advances the argument that an innovative institutional form - crowdfunding - has emerged to address the needs of social entrepreneurs and other entrepreneurs with limited access to traditional sources of capital. To examine this, we study whether and how a sustainability orientation affects entrepreneurs' ability to acquire financial resources through crowdfunding and hypothesize that a venture's sustainability orientation will enhance its fundraising capability. We also suggest that project legitimacy and creativity mediate the relationship between a sustainability orientation and funding success. Our analysis produces two key findings: 1) a sustainability orientation positively affects funding success of crowdfunding projects, and 2) this relationship is partially mediated by project creativity and third party endorsements. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.},

abstract={Policy makers often see entrepreneurship as a panacea for inclusive growth in underdeveloped 'Base of the Pyramid' (BOP) regions, but it may also lead to unanticipated negative outcomes such as crime and social exclusion. Our objective is to improve the understanding of how entrepreneurship policies can lead to socially inclusive growth at the BOP. Drawing on data collected from Brazilian tourism destinations with varying entrepreneurship, innovation, and social inclusion policies, we argue that weak institutions coupled with alert entrepreneurs encourage destructive outcomes, especially if entrepreneurship policies are based solely on economic indicators. Policies addressing both economic and social perspectives may foster more productive entrepreneurial outcomes, albeit at a more constrained economic pace. The study extends the related BOP, entrepreneurship, global value chain, and sustainable tourism literatures by examining the poor as entrepreneurs, the role of local innovation, and how entrepreneurship policies generate different social impacts within poor communities. © 2012 The Authors.

abstract={The purpose of this paper is to highlight the diverse world of social enterprise. This paper profiles 11 different social enterprises from around the world. These range from a profitachieving business in a very competitive industry, but one with strong social principles, through a profitable workers' cooperative to ones needing to find financial sustainability if they are to continue their social aspirations. The paper discusses a number of key issues in defining an organisation as a social enterprise and highlights the central issue of measuring success and impact. In some of the enterprises the important contribution of a pivotal social entrepreneur is apparent. The need to create and add value for customers and clients is always apparent, as is the need to find effective routes to market. It can be concluded that whilst certain beliefs and principles are routinely evident, social enterprises most certainly cannot be described as “onesizefitsall”.

abstract={Scholars have compared and contrasted commercial and social entrepreneurship along a variety of dimensions, suggesting that entrepreneurial antecedents and outcomes differ within a social context. However, little is known about whether entrepreneurial processes differ within social contexts. In this paper, we ask to what extent the antecedents and outcomes that make social entrepreneurship unique influence entrepreneurial processes. Using an inputs-throughputs-outputs framework, we assess the relationship between four antecedents (social mission/motivation, opportunity identification, access to resources/funding, and multiple stakeholders) and three outcomes (social value creation, sustainable solutions, and satisfying multiple stakeholders) to the dimensions of entrepreneurial orientation (innovativeness, proactiveness, risk-taking, competitive aggressiveness, and autonomy) (Lumpkin and Dess, Acad Manag Rev 21(1):135-172, 1996). Our analysis suggests that many entrepreneurial processes remain essentially the same or are affected only slightly. However, autonomy, competitive aggressiveness, and risk-taking are influenced to some extent by the presence of multiple stakeholders and access to resources/funding. Entrepreneurial processes may also differ when applied to efforts to satisfy multiple stakeholders and achieve sustainable solutions. We subsequently discuss the implications of our analysis for future social entrepreneurship research and practice. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

The main aim of this paper is to add to our understanding of the process of sustainable entrepreneurship. Since the field of sustainable entrepreneurship is in a nascent stage, we conduct a qualitative study. We employ a multiple case study design to build theory. Based on four case studies we develop a model, which describes the process of sustainable entrepreneurship, including six phases: 1) recognizing a social or ecological problem; 2) recognizing a social or ecological opportunity; 3) developing a double bottom line solution; 4) developing a triple bottom line solution; 5) funding and forming of a sustainable enterprise; 6) creating or entering a sustainable market. By developing a convergent process model with two pathways, we make theoretical contributions to the emerging fields of sustainable entrepreneurship and social entrepreneurship. A key finding is that the triple bottom line of ecological, social and economic goals is integrated sequentially, not simultaneously. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

abstract={Nonprofit organizations (NPOs) contribute to society through their social value creation. They operate in an increasingly turbulent context where building sustainable organizations has emerged as a critical need. Past authors have discussed this important issue in a fragmented manner. Using multiple case studies of socially entrepreneurial NPOs, this paper examines how the need for building a sustainable organization has impacted on the strategy focus of the nonprofit organization. The findings suggest that in response to an increased competitive environment, NPOs have been forced to adopt an organizational sustainability focus in both strategic and operational levels of management. The study makes a strong contribution to current debate in social entrepreneurship and to a broader agenda concerned with developing sustainable organizations. Whilst the findings have important implications for theory and current practice, the paper concludes with suggestions for future research at the interstices of these areas. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Corporate governance is fundamentally about such questions as what business is for - and in whose interests companies should be run, and how. Wider issues such as business ethics through entire value chains, human rights, bribery and corruption, and climate change are among the great issues of our time that increasingly cross-cut the rarefied worlds of corporate boardrooms. As a result, a growing proportion of SustainAbility's work has seen the fusion of corporate governance with such wider societal concerns. This paper reviews the increasingly complex cross-connects between the rapidly mutating governance agenda and the burgeoning world of corporate responsibility, social entrepreneurship and sustainable development. We will move through three stages: (1) a brief review of work that SustainAbility has done in the area of corporate governance; (2) the three great waves of societal pressure on business since 1960, and where things seem likely to head next; and (3) some headline conclusions that emerged in this field from the World Economic Forum's 2006 annual summit in Davos. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

We identify resource utilization approaches and three associated sets of activities that illustrate the work of collective social entrepreneurs-framing, convening, and multivocality. Using illustrative case studies to examine the phenomenon, we highlight the capacity of collective action across sectors to create markets, institutions and organizations and, to derive success by resonating through embeddedness in broader social movements. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

Historically, the emphasis has been on how to translate innovations in science and technology into commercial applications. Typically, company survival is explained in terms of an 'innovation imperative' in the pursuit of profits and competitive advantage. In contrast, social innovations are triggered by an interest in improving the well-being of people in society. Social rather than economic concerns are the main driver in the development and application of new ideas to solving problems and improving social conditions. We examine the relationship between social, business and technical dimensions and develop a provisional framework for making sense of social innovation.

abstract={Addressing the environmental challenges of the 21st century requires substantial changes to the way modern society views and manages ecosystems. In particular, many authors contend that fundamental transformation of the largely sectoral, expert-centered ecosystem-management institutions of modern, Western societies is needed. There is increasing agreement that more adaptive, integrated, collaborative ecosystem-management approaches, interlinked at multiple scales, would improve society's ability to sustainably manage complex social-ecological systems. Therefore, understanding processes of transformation, and factors that may enable transformation in ecosystem management, has become an active research area. We explore ecosystem-management transformations using a social-innovation framework. Based on three local-level case studies of transformation in freshwater management, we provide a pilot assessment of factors that may promote the emergence and adoption of integrated, collaborative ecosystem-management approaches. Our analysis suggests that ongoing environmental degradation, increasing environmental awareness, and shifting societal values are creating fertile ground for the emergence and adoption of new approaches to ecosystem management. Based on the case studies we examined, we suggest that initiatives that foster environmental awareness and attachment to local ecosystems, develop capacity for social entrepreneurship in the environmental arena, promote dialogue between key stakeholders, and provide institutional support to new institutions may facilitate the emergence of integrated, collaborative ecosystem-management approaches. © 2010 by the author(s).},

This new form of hybrid venture melds the social purpose traditionally associated with non-profit organizations with the economic purpose and market-based methods traditionally associated with for-profit firms. This exploratory research inductively explores the process by which social businesses are designed. The result suggests that clear intentionality around social purpose drives the design of these ventures and their associated missions and business models such that they can creatively synthesize competing paradigms (economic and social purpose) within one venture. The tight coupling of mission, method, and operationalization allows for the multi-stakeholder promise of the business model to be fulfilled. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Economic development and social entrepreneurship often conceive of poverty as a resource allocation problem in which a lack of capital prevents the poor from increasing their income through entrepreneurship. This allocative view, however, represents only one possible approach to conceptualizing entrepreneurial opportunity. The alternative discovery- and creativity-based views place a greater emphasis on innovation which implies that superior ideas are also needed if poverty is to be reduced through firm performance. Drawing from a survey of 201 small business owners involved in a microcredit programme in Nairobi, Kenya, we find that the financial, social, human capital-performance relationships are mediated in part by innovation. Further, we find that differentiation-related innovations lead to better firm performance than novelty-related innovations. © 2012 The Authors.

abstract={Milton Friedman argued that the social responsibility of firms is to maximize profits. This paper examines this argument for the economic environment envisioned by Friedman in which citizens can personally give to social causes and can invest in profit-maximizing firms and firms that give a portion of their profits to social causes. Citizens obtain social satisfaction from corporate social giving, but corporate giving may not be a perfect substitute for personal giving. The paper presents a theory of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and shows that CSR is costly when it is an imperfect substitute. When investors anticipate the CSR, shareholders do not bear its cost. Instead, the entrepreneurs who form the CSR firms bear the cost. Shareholders bear the cost of CSR only when it is a surprise, and it is to such surprises that Friedman objects. A social entrepreneur is willing to form a CSR firm at a financial loss because either doing so expands the opportunity sets of citizens in consumption-social giving space or there is an entrepreneurial warm glow from forming the firm. Firms can also undertake strategic CSR activities that increase profits, and a social entrepreneur carries strategic CSR beyond profit maximization and market value maximization. The paper also examines the implications of taxes and the effect of the market for control for the sustainability of CSR. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this article is to determine the future proportion and variants of usage of human intellect and artificial intelligence (AI) in entrepreneurship of industry 4.0 that fits social entrepreneurship the most. It could be convergence (simultaneous utilization during the same entrepreneurial processes with the emphasis on unique features by the terms of the competition) or divergence (usage during different business processes by the terms of labor division). Design/methodology/approach: The authors determine the influence of usage of human capital and AI on the efficiency of social entrepreneurship. The authors identify the perspective directions of usage of AI in social entrepreneurship and evaluate the readiness and interest in the implementation of these directions of concerned parties. The authors also model the optimal proportions and the variant of usage of human intellect and AI in social entrepreneurship in the conditions of Industry 4.0 in the future (until 2030). Findings: It is found that social entrepreneurship will use the opportunities of Industry 4.0 for optimization of its activities until 2030, but will refuse from full automatization, using human intellect and AI at the same time. Originality/value: The most perspective directions of application of AI at social companies are a collection of social goods and services, marketing studies and promotion of social goods and services. Neither convergence nor divergence of human and artificial intellectual capital does not fully conform to the interests of concerned parties. The most preferable (optimal) variant of usage of human intellect and AI in social entrepreneurship in the Industry 4.0 is human intelligent decision support. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Social entrepreneurs resemble 'transformational leaders', combining entrepreneurial skills with a vision for the neighbourhood. Community representatives resemble 'transactional leaders' who interact with their followers. Ambivalence over trust between individuals and organisations in both partnerships and community reveals difficulties in accumulating social capital.

abstract={We analyse environmental learning in public-access community gardens ('PAC-gardens') in Berlin, representing public green spaces that are collectively managed by civil society groups. Through extensive fieldwork, and drawing upon social theories of learning, we describe learning communities in four PAC-gardens and analyse factors that influence participation and boundary interaction, that is when experiences brought in from the outside encounter socially defined competences. Results show that these PAC-gardens have self-generated social and physical structures, which to different degrees inhibit or facilitate boundary interactions, whereas skills of individuals to put those to work, in combination with the quality of the surrounding neighbourhoods, can be ascribed for creating broader participation and greater diversity in the content of learning about local sustainability. Identified learning streams included learning about gardening and local ecological conditions; about urban politics, and about social entrepreneurship. We discuss results in relation to environmental learning that combats the generational amnesia in cities about our dependence on nature, where PAC-gardens clearly distinguish themselves from more closed forms of urban gardening such as allotment gardens and gated community gardens. We conclude that PAC-gardens that intertwine gardening with social, political and economic practices can create broader and more heterogeneous learning about social-ecological conditions, and help develop sense-of-place in degraded neighbourhoods. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

The increasing diversity represents a challenge to the field as it attempts to build a scientific base of knowledge. To address this issue, we build upon a typology of different forms of social entrepreneurship to theorize about how the role of 'sites and spaces' may affect the social entrepreneurial process. Specifically, we explain how variance in the geographic focus of different types of social entrepreneurship influences the types of social networks in which social entrepreneurship is embedded. Drawing upon this logic of embeddedness, we develop propositions about how the structural embeddedness of social entrepreneurship may affect the measurement and scaling of social value.

abstract={This paper questions the application of the entrepreneurship discourse to social entrepreneurship in the UK and looks at how people 'doing' social enterprise appropriate or re-write the discourse to articulate their own realities. Drawing on phenomenological enquiry and discourse analysis, the study analyses the micro discourses of social entrepreneurs, as opposed to the meta rhetorics of (social) entrepreneurship. Analysis using both corpus linguistics software and Critical Discourse Analysis showed a preoccupation among interviewees with local issues, collective action, geographical community and local power struggles. Echoes of the enterprise discourse are evident but couched in linguistic devices that suggest a modified social construction of entrepreneurship, in which interviewees draw their legitimacy from a local or social morality. These findings are at odds ideologically with the discursive shifts of UK social enterprise policy over the last decade, in which a managerially defined rhetoric of enterprise is used to promote efficiency, business discipline and financial independence. The paper raises critical awareness of the tension in meanings appropriated to the enterprise discourse by social enterprise policy and practice and illustrates the value of discourse analysis for entrepreneurship and social entrepreneurship research.},

It aims to explore the changing influences on entrepreneurship education and learning, what is the new era in entrepreneurship, the consequences of changing economic, social and cultural movements, and how entrepreneurship education and learning can respond to these challenges. Design/methodology/approach: The research approach is informed by practitioner-based educational enquiry, reflective practice and research, education and participation with groups of universities, educators, students, entrepreneurs and other groups during the economic crisis. Findings: The paper proposes that the nature of entrepreneurship is changing in response to social and cultural movements in the new economic era. Ethical and environmental concerns are creating a discourse of responsible entrepreneurship informed by social entrepreneurship. The paper conceptualises this as the shift from an "old" to a "new" entrepreneurship. Practical implications: Implications for the future development of enterprise and entrepreneurial education are presented, referring to the factors shaping change, including the social and economic context, learners, learning and teaching, and institutional change. Originality/value: The paper presents new thinking on the future challenges and directions for entrepreneurship and related education in the context of fundamental economic change. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

These cultures permeate activities from resource providers to front line operations. Both have roots in our psychological responses to the needs of others and are reinforced by social norms. They can work hand-in-hand or they can be at odds. Some of the icons of the social entrepreneurship movement have spoken harshly about charity, yet most of them rely to some degree, at least early in their development process, on resources that are given out of a charitable impulse. The success of social entrepreneurship requires an integration of values from each of these cultures, in which the satisfactions of giving are correlated with social benefits of rigorous problem solving. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={Across the world, a new landscape of social investment has been developing rapidly over the last 10-15 years, yet there has not been an academic study of the phenomenon to date. This paper aims to address this important gap in social entrepreneurship research with new empirical and theoretical work. Theoretically, the paper takes an interpretive approach drawing on institutional theory and other work on the sociology of markets to conceptualize social investment as a socially constructed space within which different investment logics and investor rationalities are currently in play. Using a Weberian analytic lens this paper identifies two ideal type investor rationalities (zweckrational; wertrational) that drive different institutional forms of social investment but also suggests that a third - systemic - rationality can be discerned that combines aspects of both in practice. This analysis suggests a three-part typology of social investment organized according to investor rationality that, in turn, generates a Social Investment Matrix consisting of nine distinct models. Empirically, this paper presents - for the first time - an attempt to quantify the flows of capital within the inchoate social investment landscape. The paper concludes by setting out three possible future scenarios for social investment each representing the ultimate dominance of a singular investor rationality. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={As social entrepreneurship gains increasing acclaim and institutional support, there is a need for greater critical assessment of its practices and effects, including how it relates to current concerns about meaningful work. Our critical analysis of popular autobiographies of social entrepreneurs provides insight into how marketization forces are shaping the construction of meaningful work within the US nonprofit context. Our findings illustrate that although popular portrayals of social entrepreneurship offer a compelling vision of meaningful work centred on solving pressing social problems, they also celebrate a troubling account of work/life balance centred on self-sacrifice, underpaid and unpaid labour and the privileging of organizational commitment at the expense of health, family and other aspects of social reproduction. In focusing critical attention on popular autobiographies, our analysis contributes to ongoing efforts to understand how popular culture assists in reproducing problematic assumptions about work and professional life. © The Author(s) 2010.},

abstract={The digital divide is usually conceptualized through goods-dominant logic, where bridging the divide entails providing digital goods to disadvantaged segments of the population. This is expected to enhance their digital capabilities and thus to have a positive influence on the digital outcomes (or services) experienced. In contrast, this study is anchored in an alternative service-dominant logic and posits that viewing the divide from a service perspective might be better suited to the context of developing countries, where there is a huge divide across societal segments in accessing basic services such as healthcare and education. This research views the prevailing differences in the level of services consumed by different population segments (service divide) as the key issue to be addressed by innovative digital tools in developing countries. The study posits that information and communication technologies (ICTs) can be leveraged to bridge the service divide to enhance the capabilities of service-disadvantaged segments of society. But such service delivery requires an innovative assembly of ICT as well as non-ICT resources. Building on concepts from service-dominant logic and service science, this paper aims to understand how such service innovation efforts can be orchestrated. Specifically, adopting a process view, two Indian enterprises that have developed sustainable telemedicine healthcare service delivery models for the rural population in India are examined. The study traces the configurations of three interactional resources-knowledge, technology, and institutions-through which value-creating usercentric objectives of increasing geographical access and reducing cost are achieved. The theoretical contributions are largely associated with unearthing and understanding how the three interactional resources were orchestrated for service-centric value creation in different combinative patterns as resource exploitation, resource combination, and value reinforcement. The analysis also reveals the three distinct stages of service innovation evolution (idea and launch, infancy and early growth, and late growth and expansion), with a distinct shift in the dominant resource for each stage. Through an inductive process, the study also identifies four key enablers for successfully implementing these ICT-enabled service innovations: obsessive customer empathy, belief in the transformational power of ICT, continuous recursive learning, and efficient network orchestration.},

While existing research highlights distinct skills for enabling social missions or for achieving business outcomes, we draw on paradox research to build theory about the challenges and associated skills for effectively managing the tensions emerging from the juxtaposition of social mission and business outcomes. We then use two exemplary settings for educating social entrepreneurs, one in the classroom and one in the field, to illustrate pedagogical tools for teaching these skills.

However, SE founders appear to be organizing under both for-profit and nonprofit organizational forms to engage in essentially the same activities. We investigate this lack of consistency regarding the choice of organizational form by examining two possible explanations: a difference in motivational goals among social entrepreneurs or perceived ambiguity regarding trends in core dimensions of the institutional environment. Overall, we argue that founder perceptions of an ambiguous institutional environment are leading to the variance in choice of organizational form for SE ventures.

The purpose of this paper is to examine how the political "unconscious" operates in the narration of social entrepreneurship and how it poses a limit to alternative forms of thinking and talking. Design/methodology/approach: To move the field beyond a predominantly monological way of narrating, various genres of narrating social entrepreneurship are identified, critically discussed and illustrated against the backdrop of development aid. Findings: The paper identifies and distinguishes between a grand narrative that incorporates a messianistic script of harmonious social change, counter-narratives that render visible the intertextual relations that interpellate the grand narration of social entrepreneurship and little narratives that probe novel territories by investigating the paradoxes and ambivalences of the social. Practical implications: The paper suggests a minor understanding and non-heroic practice of social entrepreneurship guided by the idea of "messianism without a messiah." Originality/value: The paper suggests critical reflexivity as a way to analyze and multiply the circulating narrations of social entrepreneurship. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Academic and practitioner interest in how market-based organizations can drive positive social change (PSC) is steadily growing. This paper helps to recast how organizations relate to society. It integrates research on projects stimulating PSC—the transformational processes to advance societal well-being—that is fragmented across different streams of research in management and related disciplines. Focusing on the mechanisms at play in how organizations and their projects affect change in targets outside of organizational boundaries, we (1) clarify the nature of PSC as a process, (2) develop an integrative framework that specifies two distinct PSC strategies, (3) take stock of and offer a categorization scheme for change mechanisms and enabling organizational practices, and (4) outline opportunities for future research. Our conceptual framework differentiates between surface- and deep-level PSC strategies understood as distinct combinations of change mechanisms and enabling organizational practices. These strategies differ in the nature and speed of transformation experienced by the targets of change projects and the resulting quality (pervasiveness and durability), timing, and reach of social impact. Our findings provide a solid base for integrating and advancing knowledge across the largely disparate streams of management research on corporate social responsibility, social entrepreneurship, and base of the pyramid and open up important new avenues for future research on organizing for PSC and on unpacking PSC processes. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.},

abstract={The proliferation of policy think tanks and more broadly the rise of 'policy networks' can be viewed as indicative of important global transformations in the nature of the state. That is, the emergence of new state modalities, with a shift away from government towards forms of polycentric governance, where policy is produced through multiple agencies and multiple sites of discourse generation. This paper addresses some particular aspects of this shift by focusing on a set of relationships and sites which have had some kind of influence upon the social and educational policies of UK New Labour governments. It has two main concerns. First, focusing on the generation and circulation of some of the key policy 'ideas' of New Labour, it maps out a related and overlapping set of policy networks which join-up government, think tanks and some individual interlockers, who 'straddle sectors and policy fields and settings'. Second, it highlights some of the main discursive elements that flow through these networks, in particular those of innovation and enterprise. They give particular emphasis on the role of 'social enterprise' and social entrepreneurs in the modernisation of public service provision and in providing solutions to intractable social problems. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.},

Case studies of 10 social enterprises reveal that rhetorical strategy aims to overcome this barrier. The findings suggest that the rhetorical strategy used by these enterprises casts the organization as protagonist and those that challenge the change as antagonists. The microstructures underlying this strategy include vocabulary sets that invoke socially accepted meta-narratives, and rhetorical devices that heighten the positive of the protagonist meta-narratives and the negative of the antagonist meta-narratives. The rhetorical strategy weaves together these protagonist and antagonist themes to create tension and persuade the audience of the organization's legitimacy. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

While economic literature has been focused primarily on the ownership and control structure as a source of the difference, we argue that this focus paints an incomplete picture.

They may also offer insights into strategies and survival in global markets of successful co-operative firms. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

However, it only seems feasible today to identify a few criteria that were most debated: the specific role of individual social entrepreneurs, the place of social innovation, the search for market income and the issue of governance. The arena of conceptualization efforts should now be fed with more contributions starting from bottom-up approaches built upon a hypothesis that could be termed “the impossibility of a unified definition”. In this paper, we develop a theoretical framework combining principles of interest (mutual, general and capital interest) and resource mixes to identify institutional trajectories generating four major SE models. We then show that all four SE models may address the actual diversity of SE’s social missions. Finally, we suggest that such social missions may be enhanced differently depending on the respective governance mechanisms. © 2017, International Society for Third-Sector Research and The Johns Hopkins University.},

Building on organizational identity theory, we examine how the dual identity of social ventures grounded within the social and entrepreneurship sectors prompts SVCs to value the resources and goals of both sectors. We use policy capturing to study the decision rules of 44 SVCs, finding that criteria of both sectors influenced SVC assessments, and entrepreneurial sector criteria were relied on most strongly in these assessments. Furthermore, not all SVCs evaluate social ventures similarly; their social investment focus influences their emphasis on social and entrepreneurial sector criteria. © 2010 Baylor University.},

abstract={Empathy is a key trait distinguishing social entrepreneurs from traditional entrepreneurs, and an important antecedent of social entrepreneurial (SE) intentions. Yet, little research explains the mechanisms through which empathy motivates SE intentions. We argue that studying the link between the prosocial trait of empathy and the prosocial outcome of SE intentions requires a prosocial lens that traditional entrepreneurial intent theories cannot offer. Building on prosocial motives research, we propose that empathy explains SE intentions through two complementary mechanisms: self-efficacy (an agentic mechanism), and social worth (a communal mechanism). We find support for our hypotheses in a study of 281 university students. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

Most management research in this area studies the entrepreneurs; we explore the institutional conditions which frame the likelihood of entrepreneurial engagement. We name these conditions 'crescive' and, following A.O. Hirschman's studies on institutional conditions for development we identify two analytically different sets of conditions: those that can stir up actors' motivations to engage and those that can alter their decision making logic. Our exploration of crescive conditions yields a novel conceptual model for entrepreneurial engagement in the context of complex social problems, which we label 'crescive entrepreneurship' and place in a space between functionalist and institutional action. © 2012.},

abstract={Why do so many social innovations fail to have a broad impact? Successful social entrepreneurs and nonprofit organizations often "scale out" innovative solutions to local problems in order to affect more communities or numbers of individuals. When faced with institutional barriers, they are motivated to "scale up" their efforts to challenge the broader institutional rules that created the problem. In doing so, they must reorient their own and their organizations' strategies, becoming institutional entrepreneurs in the process. This article proposes a contextual model of pathways for system change consisting of five different configurations of key variables and informed by qualitative interview data from selected nonprofit organizations. The authors argue that the journey from social to institutional entrepreneurship takes different configurations depending on the initial conditions of the innovative initiatives. Despite an expressed desire to engage in system change, efforts are often handicapped by the variables encountered during implementation. © The Author(s) 2014.},

The present study adopts a systems approach to the study of social alliances and concurrently analyzes the objectives instrumental in the formation of the cross-sector collaboration, the inputs provided by the partners and the outcomes and social transformation impact of the social alliances in a subsistence market place context. The research questions addressed by the study are "Why and with what consequences do business and social enterprises establish alliances?" The exploratory research follows the methodological tradition of using case studies in collaborations. Comparative analyses of the six social alliance cases indicate patterns regarding the adoption and prioritization of alliance- and partner-level objectives, provision of resources by partners, intended scope and social transformation impact, and measurement of results. Some of the observed patterns support prior research and are in line with the resource dependence and institutional perspectives. Despite their limited capacity for significant social change, the results highlight the potential of incremental contributions of social alliances in social transformation in subsistence market places. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Social entrepreneurial organizations have gained in awareness and interest among researchers, yet we know relatively little about how these organizations are able to create social and economic value. This paper seeks to understand how such organizations have managed to achieve scale and sustainability in developing economies — often lacking the institutions, networks and resources required to support their growth — whilst also maintaining their focus on a social mission. The paper presents a comparative case analysis of three social entrepreneurial organizations based in Bangladesh, Egypt and Spain that have been widely recognized as successful. It utilizes an explorative research approach with data gathered from many sources including published and unpublished articles, existing case studies, personal interviews and internet sources. Analysis of these three business models reveals common patterns in the use of strategic resources, in their value networks, and in customer interface. The findings suggest that successful social entrepreneurial organizations: proactively create their own value networks of companies that share their social vision; develop resource strategies as an integral part of the business model; and integrate their target groups into the social value network. There are limitations in the sampling and data analysis approach, however, this study provides a first step towards a more inclusive empirical research agenda in the future. The paper offers interesting insights for existing for-profit multi-business companies to rethink their business models, particularly for developing country contexts. This paper encourages managers to think beyond the creation of economic value and demonstrates how social entrepreneurs achieve sustainable growth based on building complementary networks of stakeholders and resources integrated into the value chain. It provides propositions regarding the business models of successful social entrepreneurial organizations and hopes to stimulate managerial interest in alternative business models and future empirical research which builds on these qualitative findings. © 2007, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

abstract={One of the major scholarly challenges of social entrepreneurship is the lack of an established epistemology that partly contributes to and/or stems from a conflict of discourses. This study is an attempt to pave the way for the enhancement of the field of social entrepreneurship, using Schumpeter's perspective developed in his magnum opus “Theorie der wirtschaftlichen Entwicklung”, by highlighting the role it can play in transforming business into an engine for sustainable development with an emphasis on the role that social enterprises can play. The study employs concepts of corporate citizenship, social entrepreneurship, corporate social responsibility, social enterprise, and sustainable development to form a robust conceptual understanding of the field. A canvas alongside a set of tools are developed to enlighten the way towards achieving sustainable development. The study is primarily of interest to socio-economic policy makers and social entrepreneurship scholars and benefits social and business enterprises as well. The implications of the canvas are tripartite. Firstly, the canvas demonstrates the main elements of the current socio-economic ecosystem and how they could work in unison towards the realization of sustainable development agenda. Secondly, it helps to connect diverse yet related concepts in a pragmatic manner and, as a result, lays the foundation for the realization of Sustainable Development Goals of post-2015 development agenda of the United Nations with an emphasis on the role of social enterprises. Thirdly, the canvas, in conjunction with the concomitant analyses, helps companies to understand the level of maturity and integration of their sustainable and responsible strategies. Finally, the study highlights the role social enterprises and sustainable businesses can play in achieving Sustainable Development Goals. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={We explore how social entrepreneurship (SE) research extends the field of international entrepreneurship (IE) to affect global sustainable well-being. Well-being is a multidimensional concept that includes financial, social, and environmental wealth creation. Much of IE research thus far has been based primarily on assumptions of economic opportunity recognition, evaluation, and exploitation. We use the SE perspectives of blended value and international governance to revise the definition, assumptions, and boundaries of IE at the firm and international policy levels. We propose a broader vision for the IE field based on an expanded set of assumptions beyond traditional economic thinking. © 2013 Baylor University.},

abstract={Building upon recent developments in entrepreneurship education, we propose a novel framework for social entrepreneurship education founded upon a conception of social entrepreneurs as entrepreneurs embedded in competing institutional logics. Our model, in addition to teaching students "about" social entrepreneurship to allow them to acquire the knowledge and expertise required to successfully engage in social entrepreneurial activities, proposes to educate students "for" social entrepreneurship, by allowing them to acquire the skill of bridging three distinct and sometimes competing institutional logics: the social-welfare logic, the commercial logic, and the public-sector logic. To achieve this goal, we propose that social entrepreneurship education needs to make students aware of these different logics, to allow them to enact these competing logics and to enable them to combine logics when necessary to create innovative hybrid strategies. We explore how this overall strategy can be achieved by highlighting how various pedagogical tools can be adapted to contribute to each step. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.},

abstract={In 2005, the British parliament passed legislation to make available the first new legal form of incorporation in over a century: the Community Interest Company (CIC). This initiative represented an important element within a larger set of public policy measures that aimed to create a more enabling environment for the accelerated growth of social entrepreneurship and, specifically, social enterprises. In an exploratory study, this paper presents an analysis of the regulatory space within which the reporting and disclosure practices for CICs were negotiated. Three elements within the regulatory space are identified as having explanatory value: regulatory boundaries that set and limit the terms of negotiation around regulatory practice; the key actors that engage in a process of negotiation around the establishment of actual practice; the range of debate and conflicting ideas that inform regulatory negotiation and legitimating consensus. The analysis suggests that a normative logic of light touch regulation was of particular importance within the wider UK policy context from within which CICs emerged and that the CIC Regulator acts as a mediator of disclosure information across multiple user constituencies. Empirically, this paper draws upon a sample of 80 published CIC annual reports to consider two aspects of CIC reporting: the quantity of information provided and the type of data presented. These data demonstrate the limitations and challenges of current CIC regulatory disclosure practices for key users of reporting information, particularly in terms of perceptions of organizational legitimacy. Conclusions are drawn concerning these limitations, particularly in terms of their implications for public policy. In terms of new research, this paper makes two important contributions. First, it develops theory in terms of (social) reporting and public policy with respect to the regulatory mechanisms that relate the two. This has yet to be explored in social entrepreneurship research. Second, this paper includes a preliminary examination of the reporting practices of CICs in their policy context, including an analysis of a sample of the publicly available CIC annual reports that have been filed to date. This data set has yet to be the subject of any other academic research. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Purpose: To fully understand the concept of social entrepreneurship (SE), contextual factors need to be accounted as the influence of the institutional environment on individual behaviour has received little attention in the literature. By heeding the research call for quantitative work in this emerging field, hypotheses are formulated which predict the influence of different institutional profiles on SE intentions. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: A cross-sectional survey design was administered in an under-researched emerging market context – South Africa. Hypotheses were then statistically tested using correlational analysis and structural equation modelling. Findings: The results indicate that the regulatory environment has a positive and significant impact on feasibility and desirability, and furthermore both feasibility and desirability positively affect intentions. Originality/value: The study contributes towards a new understanding of the influence of the institutional environment on social entrepreneurial intentions and its antecedents in an African emerging market context, and may serve as a catalyst for this emerging and important global activity. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={We examine entrepreneurs’ economic, social, and environmental goals for value creation for their new ventures. Drawing on ethics of care and theories of societal post-materialism, we develop a set of hypotheses predicting patterns of value creation across gender and countries. Using a sample of 15,141 entrepreneurs in 48 countries from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, we find that gender and cultural values of post-materialism significantly impact the kinds of value creation emphasized by entrepreneurs. Specifically, women entrepreneurs are more likely than men to emphasize social value goals over economic value creation goals. Individuals who start ventures in strong post-materialist societies are more likely to have social and environmental value creation goals and less likely to have economic value creation goals. Furthermore, as levels of post-materialism rise among societies, the relationship between value creation goals and gender changes, intensifying both the negative effect of being female on economic value goals and the positive effect on social value goals. In other words, post-materialism further widens the gender gap in value creation goals. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

High-growth firms make up a small share of all entrepreneurial activity but create the majority of economic growth. Compared to their male counterparts, female entrepreneurs are fewer in number (one-third of all entrepreneurs) and tend to start ventures with lower financial capital and growth expectations. Social entrepreneurs generally have high levels of education and pursue social objectives, often remedying market failures with innovative solutions.

abstract={Supported by a qualitative study of triple bottom line (TBL) firms—those that simultaneously prioritize economic, social, and environmental objectives—we investigated the market logic and practices of TBL firms to better understand how they fulfill their mission and achieve their goals. We explored if and how TBL firms may differ in their approach to stakeholders and the management of their resources, including dynamic capabilities. We employed a research design that emphasizes the iterative comparison of narrative data within themselves and with scholarly literature [i.e., resource-based view (RBV)] to develop new theoretical insights. Because the RBV is commonly used to theorize how firms achieve competitive advantage, we explored whether TBL firms achieve competitive advantage differently from what RBV theory would predict. Our data suggest that how a firm defines value has a significant influence on the capabilities it creates and how it treats its resources. We find that TBL firms redefine value to not only focus on the end product or service but also to include the systemic cost of delivering goods. As a result, TBL firms differ from prevailing scholarly thought in RBV. They strive to have resources that are sustainable and therefore imitable, commonly found, and substitutable. Moreover, they are not only transparent in their processes but also collaborate with others in the value chain and in their sector. In doing so, they deliberately create new markets from which other firms can benefit. Rather than focusing on competitive advantage, they focus on collaborative advantage. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

We investigate the extent to which social entrepreneurship coursework aligns with how practitioners prioritize competencies that lead to success in social entrepreneurship and discuss the implications for social entrepreneurship course development. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.},

We analyze the time period between January and June 2020 and demonstrate that while most of the investment funds exhibit stressed performance, social entrepreneurship funds endured resilience. This performance remained robust during the various stages of evolution of this contagion. The social funds also demonstrated volatility timing that was absent for most of their counterparts. We attribute the overall stability of these funds to their niche investments in social enterprises that specialize in providing innovative solutions for social issues. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

This has concentrated attention on the contribution that philanthropists might make in addressing socio-economic challenges, and on the role that social innovation might play in regenerating communities. This article adds to the literature on social innovation and social entrepreneurship that aims to integrate theory and empirical practice. By examining social innovation through the lens of a case study of the Community Foundation for Tyne & Wear and Northumberland, the article sheds light on how the sites and spaces of socially innovative philanthropic projects may have a bearing on their success; attention is drawn to the importance of community engagement on the part of social innovators, and the power of self-organization in re-embedding communities. It suggests that storytelling by committed philanthropists may serve as a powerful proselytizing tool for recruiting new donors. © The Author(s) 2012.},

abstract={Research Summary: This research uses insights from field theory to explore the early moments of how entrepreneurial ecosystems form through everyday interactions. We examine the cultural-cognitive and material micro-dynamics of activities occurring in support of social impact entrepreneurs and businesses from 2000 to 2014 in the Seattle, Washington, region using archival and interview data sources. The pattern of results about what actors do and how interactions change over time supports a two-period model of ecosystem formation where initial distributed and disparate activity undergoes a phase transition to coalesce into a more coordinated and integrated social order. The findings point to endogenous sources of structuring, including language and interaction, rather than exogenous sources such as government action or instrumental policy goals. Managerial Summary: How do the ecosystems that support entrepreneurs form? Rather than being created through top-down actions of governments and other powerful actors, we argue that entrepreneurial ecosystems form through the everyday interactions of individuals striving to create shared meaning, resources, and infrastructure needed to support their new ventures. This is especially true in ecosystems focused on creating social impact, which do not always offer the high returns expected in a market-based capitalistic system. Our study shows how the initial activities of distributed, disparate individuals and groups rather suddenly coalesce into more coordinated, integrated, and durable patterns of social interaction, creating the methods, resources, and legitimacy needed for an entrepreneurial ecosystem for social impact businesses to coexist with or change existing conventions of market-based capitalism.

It identifies three distinct narratives: a public sector reform narrative; a financial sector reform narrative; and a cautionary narrative. These are analyzed relative to three themes: public versus private values; outcomes contracting; and risk allocation. The first two narratives are complementary and offer a ‘win-win’ portrayal of SIBs. The third narrative challenges this dominant commentary by highlighting potential risks. There is limited empirical evidence on active SIBs to support these narratives. SIBs may have the potential to align public and private interests while improving outcomes for people affected by entrenched social problems, but this is yet to be established and appears less probable than the third more cautionary narrative. More empirical research is needed to consider the potential risks, drawbacks, benefits and alternatives of SIBs in different settings. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

Drawing on case studies in Latin America, we suggest the presence of a 'mission measurement paradox' that affects social entrepreneurs in their attempts to measure social impact and understand value creation. The paradox suggests that social entrepreneurs are failing to evaluate their social impact with sufficient regard to their social mission. Preconceptions resulting from the use of traditional management approaches in social enterprises are presented, with guidance on how these can be avoided by both researchers and practitioners. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={This paper questions the taken-for-granted moral portrayal depicted in the extant literature and popular media of the devoted social entrepreneurial hero with a priori good ethical and moral credentials. We confront this somewhat ‘idealistic’ and biased portrayal with insights from unique large-scale data from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor 2009 survey on social entrepreneurship covering Belgium and The Netherlands. Binary and multinomial logistic regressions indicate that the intention and dominance of perceived social value creation over economic value creation is indeed what makes social entrepreneurs unique. In contrast to the extant literature, however, our empirical investigation points at a reluctant attitude of social entrepreneurs toward entrepreneurship in terms of confidence in their skills to start and manage a business, their perception of entrepreneurship as a desirable career choice and their involvement in their activities. While the extant literature points at a strong entrepreneurial orientation as a source of ethical issues (e.g., mission drift, profit orientation), the main contribution of this study lies in the reverse observation: ethical issues are also likely to emanate from a frail entrepreneurial profile. We formulate empirically grounded propositions that may serve as a basis for theory-building and testing purposes. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

The study draws from literature on knowledge transfer, corporate partnerships, and corporate social innovation (CSI) and extends the authors’ previous research on corporate social responsibility (CSR) and sustainability-oriented innovation. Observations draw on a five-year longitudinal, multi-company, multinational study of over 70 firms. The research shows that much of the knowledge exchanged in CSI is tacit knowledge that companies develop from shared interactions and experiences. This article describes CSI relationship platforms along two dimensions: 1) distance of engagement from firm value chain, and 2) intensity of investments and interactions. This research relies on inductive methods and aims at pattern definition and theory building rather than theory testing. Specific examples explain CSI processes and provide guidance to managers. The findings have relevance to companies seeking to innovate in the CSR and “shared value” space, to social entrepreneurs, and to researchers interested in these topics. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Strategic niche management (SNM), a tool to understand and manage radical socio-technical innovations and facilitate their diffusion, has always departed from a technical artefact. Many radical innovations, however, do not revolve around such an artefact. Social entrepreneurship is a new business model that combines a social goal with a business mentality and is heralded as an important new way to create social value such as sustainability. This study examines if and how SNM can be applied to such a social innovation. It identifies theoretical and practical limitations and proposes solutions. The main conclusion is that SNM can be used to analyse radical social innovation, although it requires rethinking the initial entry point for research and management. Exemplifying quotes are proposed as an alternative. Second, this paper suggests using values to describe niche-regime interaction as a better way to anticipate future niche-regime interactions. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={This paper contributes to a recent movement to reframe entrepreneurship theory into a more critical and reflexive mode. It builds on the processual notion of entrepreneuring-as-emancipation to theorize a balanced conception of agency and active constraint rooted in the notion of power rituals. We develop a micro-sociological analysis of power rituals that conceives power reproduction and entrenchment as a 'practice-based' activity that focuses on what power holders and subordinates concretely do, think and feel. This makes emotion a key dimension of entrepreneurial agency and redefines constraining barriers to agency in terms of a social process of 'barring'. This novel approach is illustrated using an autobiographical account of a social entrepreneurship project. On the basis of this analysis, a number of insights are provided into the ways in which the power-as-practice approach can inform wider debates in organization studies where the notions of agency and constraint are linked to issues of power and resistance. © The Author(s) 2011.},

abstract={The likelihood of pandemics has been perceived very low till very recently. Therefore, the exponential spread of Covid-19 was a major surprise that has resulted in a global rout of financial markets. In this study, we document some preliminary evidence of performance and investment styles of European funds during the evolution of Covid-19. We assess the period between January and May 2020 and categorized the spread of contagion in three phases. The results document that Social Entrepreneurship funds demonstrated positive returns across the three phases, while most of the other subcategories plunged into negative zone. Our findings on style analysis suggest that fund managers have been drifting from high risk option to low risk in terms of size and investment strategy. Similarly, there has been a switch from high risk to relatively less sensitive sectors and a transition of investment from countries with higher to those with lower number of cases. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.},

However, these entrepreneurs suffer from a lack of finance since the bank system as well as the microfinance sector are unwilling or unable to finance them. However, pioneering finance initiatives have been emerging recently to bridge this gap. This paper discusses these emerging alternative financing initiatives which are forming an innovation eco-system of support for inclusive innovation and social entrepreneurship. It highlights two instruments in particular that are used in conventional innovation support: business incubation and venture capital. Two case studies are undertaken in order to provide evidence on how such instruments can operate with a 'dual bottom line' in supporting inclusive innovation and social entrepreneurship. © 2011.},

abstract={This article identifies power, subjectivity, and practices of freedom as neglected but significant elements for understanding the ethics of social entrepreneurship. While the ethics of social entrepreneurship is typically conceptualized in conjunction with innate properties or moral commitments of the individual, we problematize this view based on its presupposition of an essentialist conception of the authentic subject. We offer, based on Foucault’s ethical oeuvre, a practice-based alternative which sees ethics as being exercised through a critical and creative dealing with the limits imposed by power, notably as they pertain to the conditioning of the neoliberal subject. To this end, we first draw on prior research which looks at how practitioners of social enterprises engage with government policies that demand that they should act and think more like prototypical entrepreneurs. Instead of simply endorsing the kind of entrepreneurial subjectivity implied in prevailing policies, our results indicate that practitioners are mostly reluctant to identify themselves with the invocation of governmental power, often rejecting the subjectivity offered to them by discourse. Conceiving these acts of resistance as emblematic of how social entrepreneurs practice ethics by retaining a skeptical attitude toward attempts that seek to determine who they should be and how they should live, we introduce three vignettes that illustrate how practices of freedom relate to critique, the care for others, and reflected choice. We conclude that a practice-based approach of ethics can advance our understanding of how social entrepreneurs actively produce conditions of freedom for themselves as well as for others without supposing a ‘true self’ or a utopian space of liberty beyond power. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={While the economic and environmental dimensions of the triple bottom line (TBL) have been covered extensively by management theory and practice, the social dimension remains largely underrepresented. The resource-based view (RBV) of the firm and the natural resource-based view (NRBV) of the firm are revisited to lay the theoretical foundation for exploring how the social dimension might be addressed. Social capabilities are then explored by looking at the social entrepreneurship literature and illustrative cases with the purpose of elaborating RBV toward a social resource-based view (SRBV) of the firm. Three illustrative cases, which represent social businesses located in catastrophe-ridden Haiti, show how capabilities are used to overcome challenging constraints. The goal for the social entrepreneur is to employ the appropriate capabilities to ensure economic success, a positive environmental impact, and social benefits that leave the local community in a better position than without the business. Just as NRBV is a previous elaboration of RBV, so can SRBV be an elaborated theoretical foundation for future research. The components of a theory are systematically addressed by extending the range of variables (adding social capabilities), extending the domain (including stakeholders with economic, environmental, and/or social stakes), and offering propositions on variable relationships and outcome predictions (linking social capabilities and shared TBL value creation). By highlighting the social capabilities of social entrepreneurs, this research illuminates the micro-foundations of corporate social responsibility, emphasizing the value of individual level analyses. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explain how context shapes what becomes entrepreneurial. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is part of a longitudinal study over ten years, an ethnographic work including interviews, participating in meetings and shadowing. Texts and voices boiled down to transcripts and notes were sorted in NVivo. The empirical material was presented as a simple, short story, with the aim to question established assumptions and relations. The paper propose context as the unit for analysis, instead of entrepreneurs and outcomes. This opened up the scale from a narrow individualism to a much broader appreciation of the entrepreneurship as shaped by social factors. Findings: The paper provides insights about how context determines entrepreneurship. It is not simply the context in itself, but the things that are going on in the context. What entrepreneurship does is to connect and thus create a raft of changes. The paper suggests that to depart from context as the unit of analysis will avoid the objectification of entrepreneurship and open up for discussing the becoming of entrepreneurship. The case illustrates how entrepreneurship is an event in a flow of changing circumstances. Entrepreneurship is formed from the context itself, rather than being individual or social; entrepreneurship appears simultaneously to be both. Entrepreneurship can and does exist in multiple states regardless of the observer and the observation. Originality/value: This paper fulfils an identified need to learn more about how entrepreneurship and context interact. It illustrates how context is more engaged in the entrepreneurial process than entrepreneurship theory acknowledges. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Twenty seven face-to-face interviews were conducted with key informants in a developing country case study context. The key resources required for social value creation in tourism are natural; financial; political and institutional and human capital. These resources enable the generation of social value at three levels with interlocking value creation processes: at an individual stakeholder level; at the meso level and at the macro-level. Strategies associated with resource mobilisation are stakeholder involvement and collaboration; and relationship development and local community empowerment. A shared understanding of the role of tourism and cultural values is critical. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={This study examines entrepreneurial passion and components of entrepreneurial identity – sameness, otherness, and identity centrality and salience – in two different contexts, high-tech and social entrepreneurship. Based on life story interviews of 45 high-tech entrepreneurs (HTE) and social entrepreneurs (SEs), passion and identities are linked for each group but evolve differently. For HTEs, passion is composed of a strong challenge to lead a meaningful activity and to leave a ‘fingerprint’. SE passion is characterized more in terms of enthusiasm and excitement and a desire to make a mark. HTEs’ identities are central to their self-concept while SEs’ identities can be more salient than central. SE identities are more synchronized than those of HTEs. For HTEs, otherness is dominant in their self-concept; however, they also maintain a concept of sameness. The findings of this study expand the literature by showing that passion is a dynamic motivational construct that is associated with entrepreneurs’ self-concept of their role identities. The interrelations between entrepreneurial passion and self-concepts of role identities are perceived differently among entrepreneurs who operate in different contexts. In addition, this study also expands the literature on entrepreneurial identities and affect. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={In recent years, three notable trends have emerged in the gender and development landscape: the increasing use of sport as a tool to achieve gender and development objectives (SGD); the expanding involvement of transnational corporations (TNCs) in creating, funding and implementing development programs; and the 'girling' of development. The last trend has largely been facilitated by the proliferation of the global 'Girl Effect' campaign, or 'the unique potential of 600 million adolescent girls to end poverty for themselves and the world' (Girl Effect 2011). This article reports on findings from a global ethnography - involving semi-structured interviews, participant observation and document analysis - that considered how sport-oriented Girl Effect interventions impact the lives of girls they target. Using a Girl Effect-focused partnership among a TNC (based in Western Europe), an international nongovernmental organization (NGO) (based in Western Europe) and a Southern NGO (based in Uganda) as a case study, this article examines how SGD programs for Ugandan girls encourage them to become 'entrepreneurs of themselves' (Rose 1999) equipped to survive in the current global neoliberal climate using social entrepreneurial tactics such as training to be martial arts instructors combined with activities such as cultivating nuts. Results show how Girl Effect-oriented SGD programs that focus on social entrepreneurship tend to overlook the broader structural inequalities and gender relations that marginalize girls in the first place. I conclude by suggesting that future studies must further explore the socio-economic, cultural and political implications and consequences that social entrepreneurship and 'economic forms' of SGD interventions hold for girls. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.},

Through the examination of a case study of the Emergency and Management Research Institute (EMRI), a public private partnership (PPP), social innovation is found to be an interactive bottom-up collective learning process where EMRI has developed a new model of social innovation. It also highlights the complex context in which social innovation occurs. As a boundary-spanning activity across the public and private sectors, the interactive learning process and associated capability building for social innovation has provided a catalyst for wider social reform and for the development and redesigning of NSI for social innovation-led value creation in emerging economies. Through such an approach, the EMRI has overcome the institutional voids and developed legitimacy through social innovation tailored to the local context; it thereby represents an alternative approach to the often top-down NSI organisations of developed economies. © 2017},

Our approach relies on three specific analytical dimensions: the purpose of the initiative, its form of organisation and ownership, and its embeddedness into local community or wider social movements. We apply this analytical framework to four case studies selected from a larger empirical study on newly emerged forms of organisation in the field of renewable energy across the European Union. Drawing on our findings, we characterise social enterprises in the energy sector as collectively owned organisations that combine renewable energy production with more overarching goals of environmental and social transformation, and a specific quest for civic participation. These initiatives show strong relationships with different social movements and even a potential to transcend the local scale. We conclude that given similarities in the two areas of research provide fertile ground for mutual advancement, both conceptually and empirically. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

A careful review of extant literature reveals two distinct modes of scaling social impact - breadth and depth scale. Drawing on a longitudinal study of Naandi and Drishtee - two exemplary social ventures in rural India - it is suggested that the depth and breadth scale develop through different processes. Each venture dynamically balances a minimum critical specification of social innovation, affordability, and market penetration while scaling social impact. We chart this path to scale in the two social ventures, and find that the relationship between minimum critical specifications and social impact is mediated by contrasting approaches to resource mobilization, operating routines, and entrepreneurial adjustment. The findings suggest that the process of scaling social impact can be characterized by a punctuated equilibrium model of system change. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

Drawing from the RBV, we argue that a social enterprise’s scale of social impact depends on its capabilities to engage stakeholders, attract government support, and generate earned-income. We test our hypotheses on a sample of 171 US-based social enterprises and find support for the hypothesized relationships between these organizational capabilities and scale of social impact. Further, we find that these relationships are contingent upon stewardship culture. Specifically, we show that an entrepreneur-centered stewardship culture increases the effects of the capabilities to attract government support and to generate earned-income, while an employee-centered stewardship culture compensates for low abilities to attract government support and to generate earned-income. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

This phenomenon is called crowdfunding. Crowdfunding permits organizations and individuals to obtain investments they otherwise might not receive from more traditional sources such as banks, angel investors, and stock markets. A number of now well-known startups had their origins in crowdfunding. More recently, established organizations have begun to use crowdfunding websites not only as a source of finance, but also as marketing platforms. In this way, they have been able to ensure a ready market for their new offerings, with full sales pipelines, and to use the platforms as vehicles to boost brand image and gain support for brand-related causes. This adaptation of crowdfunding for marketing purposes is not without its problems, however, and organizations would be well advised to consider not only the opportunities these platforms provide, but also their limitations and risks. © 2016 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University},

abstract={Using England as a paradigmatic case of the ‘enterprising up’ of the third sector through social enterprise policies and programs, this article sheds light on practitioners’ resistance as enacted through dramaturgical identification with government strategies. Drawing from a longitudinal qualitative research study, which is interpreted via Michel de Certeau’s theory of the prosaic of the everyday, we present the case study of Teak, a charitable regeneration company, to illustrate how its Chief Executive Liam ‘acted as’ a social entrepreneur in order to gain access to important resources. Specifically, we establish ‘tactical mimicry’ as a sensitizing concept to suggest that third sector practitioners’ public identification with the normative premises of ‘social enterprise’ is part of a parasitical engagement with governmental power geared toward appropriating public money. While tactical mimicry conforms to governmental strategies only in order to exploit them, its ultimate aim is to increase potential for collective agency outside the direct influence of power. The contribution we make is threefold: first, we extend the recent debate on ‘productive resistance’ by highlighting how ‘playing the game’ without changing existing relations of power can nevertheless produce largely favorable outcomes. Second, we suggest that recognition of the potentiality of tactical mimicry requires methodologies that pay attention to the spatial and temporal dynamics of resistance. Finally, we argue that explaining the normalizing power of ‘social enterprise’ without consideration of the non-discursive, mainly financial resources made available to those who identify with it, necessarily risks overlooking a crucial element of the dramaturgical dynamic of discourse. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.},

abstract={This cross-country study statistically investigates the determinants of environmental orientation of entrepreneurial activity. It builds on a new institutional theory framework and uses data gathered in the course of the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor to examine the institutional impacts and individual characteristics which influence the degree of environmental orientation of entrepreneurial activity, using a multilevel analysis. Our key findings are threefold: First, the results indicate that environmental orientation is frequently used as a source for securing legitimacy of entrepreneurial ventures. Second, we find lower degrees of environmental orientation among more educated entrepreneurs. Third, for many variables, such as age, gender and income, differences are observed when compared to earlier findings on the determinants of social entrepreneurship. Policy makers can learn from the analysis that policy measures should not only be designed specifically for environmental entrepreneurship, but also be adapted to the domestic economic circumstances, as, for example, environmental taxes only show significant effects on environmental orientation of entrepreneurial ventures in OECD countries. From a practitioner’s perspective, this indicates that a lack of regulation can provide opportunities for environmentally oriented entrepreneurial ideas. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={This article explores some of the theoretical insights emerging from work in the field of social entrepreneurship and complexity theory. It draws on a neo-Schumpeterian understanding of innovation as self-organization, as it arises in the process of social entrepreneurship. Drawing on complexity theory, we use the lens of self-organization and complex adaptive systems to consider entrepreneurial activity in Maori communities where innovation occurs through the interaction of the young opportunity seeking entrepreneur (potiki) and the elder statesperson (rangatira). The interplay between these two actors in the Maori tribal community illustrates the double spiral (takarangi) dance of innovation (creation) that occurs at and between the edges of chaos and stability. Two theoretical insights emerge from this research. First, we are reminded that tradition and heritage can form the path to innovation while opportunity-seeking adventurers are necessary if steps are to be taken along the path. Second, the historical and cultural context in which innovation occurs is an important consideration for understanding both social and economic entrepreneurship. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={The multi-levelled processes taking place in Crowdfunding (CF), when tapping a large heterogeneous crowd for resources, and the often fundamentally different intentions of individual crowd members in the case of highly desirable social ventures with little prospect for economic gains, may lead to a different logic and approach to how entrepreneurship develops. Using this under-institutionalized sphere as both, context and subject, the author seeks evidence and a new understanding of entrepreneurial routes by using the sociological perspectives of Bourdieus' four forms of capital as a lens on 36 cases of social ventures. In the cases, opportunity recognition, formation and exploitation could not be distinguished as separate processes. CF and sourcing help form the actual opportunity and disperse information at the same time. In addition, the ‘nexus’ of opportunity and entrepreneur is breached in CF of social causes through the constant exchange of ideas with the crowd, leading to norm-value pairs between the funders and the entrepreneurs. Issues of identification and control are thus not based upon any formal relationship but based on perceived legitimization and offered democratic participation leading to the transformation of social capital (SC) into economic capital (EC). Success is based upon the SC of the entrepreneurial teams, yet the actual resource exchange and transformation into EC is highly moderated by cultural and symbolic capital that is being built up through the process. © 2014, Taylor & Francis.},

In this conceptual article, it is argued that the sociology of social networks may contribute to explain how and why social entrepreneurship arises by bridging micro- and macro-levels of analysis. Four different usages of the social network concept in the social entrepreneurship literature are identified: embeddedness of social entrepreneurship, collective social entrepreneurship, networking as a critical skill or activity of social entrepreneurship, and finally networking and the creation of social capital as a goal of social entrepreneurship. Theoretical frameworks explaining the emergence of conventional entrepreneurship with a social network lens are identified. These are evaluated with regard to social entrepreneurship and translated into a set of research proposals to be explored in order to strengthen our understanding of social entrepreneurship emergence. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={This paper builds on London and Hart's critique that Prahalad's best-selling book prompted a unilateral effort to find a fortune at the bottom of the pyramid (BoP). Prahalad's instrumental, firm-centered construction suggests, perhaps unintentionally, a buccaneering style of business enterprise devoted to capturing markets rather than enabling new socially entrepreneurial ventures for those otherwise trapped in conditions of extreme poverty. London and Hart reframe Prahalad's insight into direct global business enterprise toward "creating a fortune with the base of the pyramid" (p. xi) rather than at the BoP. This shift in language requires a recalibration of strategic focus, we argue, and will necessitate implementation of "moral imagination" to formulate new mental models that can frame the possibility of local entrepreneurs working collaboratively and discursively with development partners drawn from civil society, corporate, and government sectors. Successful partnerships will arise from interactive processes of emergent, co-creative learning within a shared problem domain or "community of practice". We call attention to three related pluralist framings of situated learning within such communities of practice: (1) decentered stakeholder networks; (2) global action networks; and (3) a focus on "faces and places" as a cognitive lens to humanize and locally situate diverse inhabitants within base of the pyramid partnership projects. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={In the search for sustainability and stability, a central tenet of social entrepreneurship holds that revenue diversification is desirable. Business and nonprofit researchers have long argued that by establishing and maintaining multiple streams of funding, including some combination of earned income, government contracts, foundation and corporate grants, and individual contributions, organizations are able to avoid excessive dependence on any single revenue source, stabilize their financial positions, and thereby reduce the risk of financial crises or interruptions in funding. By studying a large sample of nonprofit organizations in the US, this paper investigates whether this basic claim about the desirability of revenue diversification is both correct and complete. Against the dominant trend in the literature that focuses on the risks of revenue concentration, we find that nonprofit organizations that have highly concentrated and specialized forms of revenue actually experience some significant benefits, in the form of lower administrative and fund-raising expenses. However, these savings are associated with greater exposure to swings in an organization's financial position. Based on our study of the broader world of nonprofit organizations, we conclude that social entrepreneurs likely face a more complex set of choices about the composition of their revenue than previous research has suggested. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={This paper explores the role that entrepreneurial leadership vision plays in the entrepreneurial process of nonprofit and for-profit ventures. The results indicate significant differences in the meaning of vision articulated for each type of venture. Differences between ventures were also found with regard to the relationship that vision has with the ventures' strategies and performance. In the nonprofit organizations vision was associated with a wide-range strategy as well as the ventures' performance and growth. In addition, wide-range strategy partially mediated the relationship between the ventures' vision and its performance and growth. In business enterprises, vision directly predicted only a differentiation strategy, which also mediated the relationship between vision and the ventures' performance and growth. In contrast, a wide-range strategy in these organizations actually reduced growth. These findings contribute both to the literature on vision as well as to the literature on entrepreneurship. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

For these organizations, the assessment of social impact plays a strategic role in helping them understand to what extent their social mission has been accomplished. As a result of increasing interest in the practice of Social Impact Assessment (SIA), many models have been developed, but a system to classify them is still lacking, and so the overall picture remains rather fragmentary if not confusing. In this research, a hierarchical cluster analysis was developed based on a sample of 76 SIA models to group them in macro-categories and help social entrepreneurs choose the model that is best suited to the needs of their organization. © 2014, The Author(s) 2014.},

It draws on concepts from national innovation systems (NIS), complexity, ecosystems, and social entrepreneurship research to develop a framework for forming innovation ecosystems via social entrepreneurship. The framework is especially relevant for new market creation in renewable energy for rural and bottom of the pyramid (BOP) populations. Case studies from the renewable energy sector in India support the framework. The paper suggests that creating a robust innovation ecosystem requires the following mechanisms at the national level to provide the supporting infrastructure: (1) creation of new institutions; (2) policies to generate demand; (3) institutional support for linkages to build capabilities. Key mechanisms at the micro-level include: (1) facilitating the entry of social entrepreneurs to serve the needs of rural populations; (2) use of new technology platforms to diffuse entrepreneurial skills and enhance community interactions; and (3) establishing linkages with external organizations to enable resource acquisition. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to incorporate the demand and supply-side theories of entrepreneurship development in a series of stage-based models that analyze how macro-level and contextual variables influence social entrepreneurship activity. The paper investigates the macro-level influences, including the socio-political, cultural and economic factors that can stimulate or impede the emergence of social entrepreneurship. Although little research on these determinants has been conducted, this study seeks to reveal that several variables that are crucial in traditional entrepreneurial studies do not appear to significantly affect social entrepreneurship. Design/methodology/approach: To measure social entrepreneurial activity, the authors used the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) findings from the 2009 study. Hierarchical multiple regression was used to test three multi-level stages of the socio-political, economic, and cultural determinants of social entrepreneurship activity. The series of three stages for all of the variables were entered in the following order: first, socio-political variables; second, cultural variables; third, economic variables. This approach allows the authors to explore and thus extend the previous research reviewed here, on how the economic context beyond socio-political and cultural factors affects social enterprise activity. Findings: A three-stage analysis revealed that socio-political variables accounted for 76 percent of the variance in social entrepreneurial activity. It was found that the single greatest determinant of social entrepreneurial activity is the degree of female participation in the labor force. Additional findings and implications for understanding the role of macro-level factors on social entrepreneurship are discussed. Originality/value: Social entrepreneurship has the potential to confront and address some of society's most challenging and complex problems arising from market and government inadequacies or failures. Social entrepreneurial firms exist within environments that are often severely resource-constrained. Therefore, social entrepreneurs may rely on a unique set of strategies to mobilize resources available to them, such as collaboration with others and accessing social capital to generate value solutions for their communities. The growth of women's participation in the labor force is a powerful influence on social entrepreneurship activity, and with the increase in training programs and local networks to support women's business ownership, it is likely that this trend will continue and positively impact communities around the world. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Innovation-based strategies are uniquely characterized by a primary focus on differentiation, with innovations directed at product, process, and system change levels. They tend to actively involve both externally and internally focused learning. Nonprofit organizations' innovation strategies are strongly influenced by their organizational characteristics, in particular the need to build sustainable organizations.

abstract={This article uses an institutional approach to examine Chinese NGOs as an emerging organizational field. In mature organizational fields, the organizations are powerfully constrained to follow the institutional practices of that field. However, in an emerging organizational field, the institutionalized constraints are not yet established, so actors can try out a wide range of practices. Some of these practices will become the new rules of the game of the organizational field when it is established. The content of these rules will shape the relationship between NGOs and the Chinese party-state for future generations. We find that a Chinese NGO's resource strategy is shaped by two interacting factors. First, NGOs operate in an evolving ecology of opportunity. Second, the social entrepreneurs who lead Chinese NGOs perceive that ecology of opportunity through the lens of their personal experiences, beliefs and expertise. As a result, the initial strategies of the organizations in our sample were strongly influenced by the institutional experience of their founders. Former state bureaucrats built NGOs around alliances with party-state agencies. In contrast, NGO founders that had no party-state experience usually avoided the state and sought areas away from government control/attention, such as the internet or private business. © 2015 The China Quarterly.},

abstract={Purpose - The purpose of this research is to introduce a theory for social entrepreneurship based on integrating the entrepreneurship literature with a global empirical research carried out on social entrepreneurs using grounded theory. Theoretical contributions and insights from the social entrepreneurship literature are integrated into the research. Design/methodology/approach - This research is an exploratory inductive qualitative research based on the grounded theory methodology developed by Glaser and Strauss, and procedures developed by Strauss and Corbin with a constructivist stance. Findings - The behavioral theory of social entrepreneurship studies the contextual factors that lead to social venture creation, the underlying organization dynamics and structures, and how these typologies measure social impact, mobilize resources, and bring about sustainable social change. Research limitations/implications - The result of the research is a behavioral theory for social entrepreneurship, which introduces new organizational typologies that create, measure, and sustain social change. Studying the underlying motivations and conditions upon which social enterprises evolve will help in extending the research on management of social outcomes and impacts. As the focus of the different typologies of social enterprises is to produce measurable social impact, researching these types of social organizations will advance research in social sciences. Practical implications - Studying the phenomena of social entrepreneurship and explaining the social enterprises' unique behaviors, characteristics, and typologies will advance research for creating sustainable public wealth rather than just focusing on private wealth and business performance. While Schumpeter's entrepreneurship theory led the literature on economic growth, social entrepreneurship theory might be a factor for social development through economically sustainable and viable models. Social implications - This research will help in studying the role of social entrepreneurs in creating new social institutions and structures, promoting social movements, and mobilizing resources to create sustainable social impact. Originality/value - This research is an attempt to contribute to the social entrepreneurship literature by providing new insights about social entrepreneurship behavior. The result of the research is a behavioral theory for social entrepreneurship, which introduces new organizational typologies that create, measure, and sustain social change. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={To date, most efforts to define social entrepreneurship have focused on adapting existing management theories on entrepreneurship and non-profits rather than distinguishing the organisational purposes and structure of social entrepreneurship from traditional for-profit organisations. There is little consensus among academicians and practitioners alike as to what social entrepreneurship is and what it is not. To articulate a clear and non-ambiguous definition of social entrepreneurship, it is necessary first to understand the distinguishing features of social entrepreneurial ventures compared with corporate entrepreneurial ventures and non-profit organisations. This article differentiates these ventures in terms of their motives, goals, antecedent conditions, processes, role of the entrepreneur and outcomes. In doing so, it provides a brief summary of the state of knowledge in the emerging field of social entrepreneurship and raises new questions and hypotheses for future research on this topic. © 2011 Entrepreneurship.},

Three practices are crucial to the innovation process – i.e. an integrated approach, multiple partnerships and visionary leadership from the top. These practices address two of the main challenges companies face in innovating for sustainability, namely actively engaging with the wider dynamic context in which they operate, and spanning boundaries they are not used to crossing. – By analysing the specific context in which a business operates, it is possible to form a better idea of where on the spectrum a particular company may focus its efforts in order to have the greatest chances of success. – The analyses in this paper contribute to the debate and practical realisation of sustainable development. – While many studies distinguish between continuous versus discontinuous change as the two ends on a spectrum, the authors extend the spectrum to include three major points from incremental to radical to game-changing systemic innovation for sustainability. The three critical practices must be applied to an ever-increasing degree along the spectrum. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

Government policies, most notably David Cameron's Big Society initiative, have entrenched the concept of localism across the UK, and the move towards smaller government has placed the onus on communities to creatively tackle their own problems. While antecedent research on social innovation has largely concentrated on success stories, few have stopped to consider the profound nature of this shift and the operational obstacles it may pose for small resource-constrained organizations. This article seeks to contribute to current debates on social innovation by critically reviewing extant literature and proposing a model of 'open' social innovation. Furthermore, it serves as a tool to stimulate further discussion around the 'opening up' of the social innovation process and raises some timely questions about the efficacy of localism policy measures. © The Author(s) 2012.},

Under the theory of moral sentiments, we posit that some entrepreneurs are altruistically motivated to promote a morally effective economic system by engaging in social entrepreneurial activities. Focusing on China's Guangcai (Glorious) Program, a social entrepreneurship program initiated by China's private entrepreneurs to combat poverty and contribute to regional development, we find that private entrepreneurs are motivated to participate in such programs if they have more past distressing experiences, including limited educational opportunities, unemployment experience, rural poverty experience, and startup location hardship. Their perceived social status further strengthens these relationships. Our study contributes to the social entrepreneurship literature by offering a moral sentiment perspective that explains why some entrepreneurs voluntarily join a social entrepreneurship program to mitigate poverty in society. © 2013 The International Association for Chinese Management Research.},

abstract={Research summary: We provide an ethnographic account of how social entrepreneurs in the Safe Water for Africa program made sense of hybrid goods, as well as how and why those understandings affected both the social enterprise's marketing mix and stakeholders’ expectations of the enterprise's rights and responsibilities. We find that output maximizing-behavior enabled by prosocial motivation elicits a psychological feeling of entitlement to a socio-emotional return on investment in the form of beneficiary gratitude. When external stakeholders consider them justified, these feelings become moral norms that can induce or prevent the institutionalization of a suboptimal path of development, depending on the motivations of competitors. We show that social entrepreneurs’ emotional attachment can have consequences for development, challenging the functionalist conception of social enterprise as a temporary patch to institutional voids. Managerial summary: We present a detailed account of the Safe Water for Africa program that examines: (a) how the program's stakeholders made sense of water as a “hybrid good;” and (b) how these understandings shaped the social entrepreneurs’ attitudes, the social enterprise's marketing mix, and stakeholder's expectations of the enterprise's rights and responsibilities. We find that the same motivation that prompted social entrepreneurs to act on behalf of those without safe water elicited a sense of entitlement to a “return on investment” in the form of beneficiary gratitude. If reciprocated, these feelings may become normalized and, depending on competitors' motives, hinder long-term development efforts by precluding their entry.

Based on data from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) 2009, covering 49 countries, we test several theoretical perspectives, including the failure thesis/institutional void perspective, the interdependence theory/institutional support perspective, welfare state theory and supply-side theory. Multiple regression analyses are applied testing the influence of institutional factors and cultural values on the incidence of social entrepreneurial start-ups relative to other types of start-ups. Our results seem to support the institutional support perspective: the share of social start-ups in all start-ups seems to benefit from favorable institutional circumstances, in particular public sector expenditure and regulatory quality. With respect to cultural values, our results suggest that a society's level of self-expression values benefits start-up diversity in favor of a higher share of social start-ups. © 2016 International Council for Small Business},

The Schumpeterians take innovation as its central focus, arguing that the disruption of the status quo is an important differentiator.

It looks for insights within their 'hybrid' status, spanning state and market, and subject to multiple sets of institutional conditions. Four frames of hybrid identity are developed, and then substantiated via a discussion of two different sectors of not-for-profit social entrepreneurs in Australia and the Netherlands. As the growth trajectory of each sector is traced and the construction of hybrid identity is explored from both public and private perspectives, institutional pressures are revealed that set the current context for development. This brings forth implications for existing conceptual tools, as well as directions for new research. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={The continuous search for responsible and sustainable practices in the tourism industry paves the way for alternative approaches to tourism development. Often, local communities are at the foreground of these innovative tourism entrepreneurship and development strategies. The emergence of social enterprises operating in tourism refocuses the agenda of engaging and developing disadvantaged and underdeveloped communities sustainably through the industry. Tourism social entrepreneurship (TSE) is suggested as a market-based strategy to address social problems whilst maximising the benefits and minimising the negative consequences that tourism may provide to host communities. To date, there is limited understanding of how TSE can be a catalyst for sustainable community development. The purpose of this paper is to address this gap in knowledge by conceptualising TSE as a more holistic strategy for sustainable community development. By critically analysing the literature, this paper situates TSE within and for community development. A conceptual framework that incorporates community development concepts, generic social entrepreneurship and TSE principles, and community capitals perspectives, is proposed. This conceptual paper contributes to the emerging literature on TSE and may assist the actors in the TSE system as they establish new community-centric social enterprises. © 2018},

abstract={Research summary: Entrepreneurial behavior is core to our understanding of entrepreneurship. Yet, research progress is hindered because most studies adopt a traditional perspective of the construct that is embedded in economic rationality and focused on for-profit ventures. Drawing on identity theory, we propose a reconceptualization that emphasizes the “identity relevance” of entrepreneurial behaviors, allows for different meanings that founders associate with entrepreneurship, and views founders as behaving in ways that they deem appropriate. Importantly, this perspective accounts for the behaviors not only of entrepreneurs who start ventures strictly out of economic self-interest, but also those who launch ventures because of concern for others—either in their community or in society at large. We elaborate on this argument and discuss ideas for future research. Managerial summary: We suggest that a concept of entrepreneurial behavior predicated on the purely rent-seeking entrepreneur ignores the increasing, and increasingly important, number of entrepreneurs who start enterprises for more than pure economic rent generation. Using identity theory permits us to parse modern entrepreneurs into three major types, namely the traditional seeker of rent, the entrepreneur who seeks to aid the community, and the entrepreneur who seeks to aid society at large. We show that using an identity perspective on entrepreneurial behavior allows us to explain very different economic and social outcomes by entrepreneur social identity type and posit the influence of entrepreneurial types in society on the evolution of a macroeconomic cycle.

abstract={Resource acquisition is critically important for social ventures to fulfill their social missions while striving to scale up and become financially sustainable. Past studies have only just begun to appreciate how institutional forces shape the acquisition of resources by social ventures. Grounded in the context of microfinance organizations (MFOs), a particular type of social venture that holds promise for addressing poverty in developing nations, this paper examines how institutional logics, related to market and religion, shape the nature and amount of capital acquired by MFOs. In particular, we study how the market logic and religious diversity independently and jointly affect flows of commercial and public capital into MFOs across countries. Using a proprietary database of all traceable lending transactions between capital providers and MFOs from 2004 to 2012, we find that strong market logic enhances both commercial and public capital acquired by MFOs, whereas religious diversity decreases the amount of commercial capital flowing to MFOs. Religious diversity also mitigates the positive impact of the market logic on capital flows into MFOs. We discuss the implications of these findings for microfinance research and practice, the social entrepreneurship literature, and the institutional logics perspective. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

The social entrepreneurship is emerging as a viable alternative to the traditional institutional setups for making a sustainable impact and reach towards the underserved needs of the low-income population living in the developing economies. The existing research on social entrepreneurship lacks focus on creating an integrated framework thereby posing a limitation to the entry, growth and penetration of the social entrepreneurship based market setup. The sustainable model system comprises a combination of the constraining conditions and key choices. The constraining conditions include the environmental and firm-specific constraints like need addressed, mission type and socio-economic objectives. The relative impact and significance of the key choices vary for different social enterprises depending upon the applicable constraining conditions.},

We suggest entrepreneurship as one such process and review the literature on three types of entrepreneurship said to transform society by creating value beyond profit: social, environmental and sustainable entrepreneurship. From environmental and social scientific literature, we distil a set of requisites for sustainability-as-flourishing, a topic of growing interest. We then review the literature on social, environmental and sustainable entrepreneurship relative to these requisites. Findings show contributions and also limitations towards sustainability-as-flourishing reflected in research on each type of entrepreneurship. We propose a research agenda to address the most glaring limitations including a failure to study critical reflection processes that can shape entrepreneurs’ actions and a lack of emphasis on the Earth’s physical carrying capacity. Future research could also zero in more on complex systems thinking and consider root causes. © 2015, © 2015 SAGE Publications.},

abstract={Global estimates indicate that more than 2.3 billion people in the world suffer from poor vision due to refractive error; of which 670 million people are considered visually impaired because they do not have access to corrective treatment. Refractive errors, if uncorrected, results in an impaired quality of life for millions of people worldwide, irrespective of their age, sex and ethnicity. Over the past decade, a series of studies using a survey methodology, referred to as Refractive Error Study in Children (RESC), were performed in populations with different ethnic origins and cultural settings. These studies confirmed that the prevalence of uncorrected refractive errors is considerably high for children in low-and-middle-income countries. Furthermore, uncorrected refractive error has been noted to have extensive social and economic impacts, such as limiting educational and employment opportunities of economically active persons, healthy individuals and communities. The key public health challenges presented by uncorrected refractive errors, the leading cause of vision impairment across the world, require urgent attention. To address these issues, it is critical to focus on the development of human resources and sustainable methods of service delivery. This paper discusses three core pillars to addressing the challenges posed by uncorrected refractive errors: Human Resource (HR) Development, Service Development and Social Entrepreneurship.},

It discusses the context-dependent manifestation of opportunity in, and resistance to, social entrepreneurship. Social entrepreneurship opportunities are the constructed outcomes of entrepreneurial alertness and motivation, and the organizational, societal, institutional, and market contexts in which the entrepreneur is embedded. Likewise, these contextual forces resist and refine social innovations such that they become the products of the financial, social, cultural, and political expectations of stakeholders of social entrepreneurship ventures. A deeper understanding of how context shapes social innovation will give scholars and practitioners a greater appreciation for the ways in which innovations can succeed because of resistance, not in spite of it. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

Traditional entrepreneurs generate social value as a by-product of economic value; whereas for social entrepreneurs the reverse is true. This brings about an ambiguity in integrating business and social well being, most manifest in identity and in managing the enterprise. Moreover, the values which drive social enterprise are "different". Consequently, we examine how values shape practices and how they give direction and purpose to what social enterprises do and how this shapes identity over time. Using the social organisation as the unit of analysis, we collected the narratives about tensions and how these were reconciled. We contribute by improving our understanding of social enterprise by showing how values are worked, used and deployed to give direction in reconciling ambiguity. Moreover, these ambiguities provide a unique identity and purpose for social enterprise. © 2010 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={This paper examines the linkages between diversity management (DM), innovation and high performance in social enterprises. These linkages are explicated beyond traditional framing of DM limited to workforce composition, to include discussions of innovation through networked diversity practices; reconciliation; and funding options. The paper draws upon a UK-based national survey and the case study data. Multiple data collection methods were used, including semi-structured interviews, questionnaires and workshops with participant observation. NVivo and SPSS software packages were utilized in order to analyse the qualitative and quantitative data, respectively. We used thematic coding and cropping techniques in analysing the case studies in the paper. A broad range of conflicting and supporting literature was enfolded into the conversations and discussion. The paper demonstrates that social enterprises exhibit unique characteristics in terms of size and location, as well as their double remit to add value both economically and socially. As a conclusion, we argue for social enterprises to consider options for DM in the interests of maximization of innovation and business performance. We contend that further research is needed to describe how social entrepreneurs draw upon their various 'diversity resources' in the process of innovation. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={According to existing literature, the core of social entrepreneurship (SE) knowledge is evolving and, as such, it has made important contributions to theoretical definitions and essential characterizations. However, more theoretical issues need to be addressed before the SE field can be fully explained and understood. In particular, the authors observe in the literature that, within empirical or conceptual studies, almost all authors use the term ‘value’, but seemingly assume the dimensions of value rather than define or analyse its connotations and components. This paper uses the value construct and its multi-faceted dimensions to deconstruct the way in which value is created in the SE context. The authors argue that an analysis based on value generation, value capture and value sharing provides important insights into the specificity of SE research and can facilitate future theorizing. Through the conceptual lens of this central concept of value emanating from value theory and business model literature, the authors abductively analyse and classify the studies, providing a practical resource. The authors discuss the phenomenon, presenting an integrative framework that facilitates a clearer understanding of the social value creation process and suggest future research areas as openings for theory development in relation to value creation, its main components and flows. © 2016 British Academy of Management and John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={In this article, we discuss how the human resource development (HRD) function can support corporate sustainability strategy by designing and implementing leadership development programs incorporating international service learning assignments. We describe "Project Ulysses," an integrated service learning program that involves sending participants in teams to developing countries to work in cross-sector partnerships with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and social entrepreneurs, supporting them in their fight against pressing global problems. We present the findings of a narrative analysis of learning stories produced by Ulysses participants. Understanding how participants make sense of, and learn from, their experiences abroad provides us with insights into how service learning programs can help managers to develop the knowledge, skills, and mind-set that will enable them to successfully support a company's global sustainability and corporate social responsibility (CSR) efforts. We conclude by discussing the implications for leadership development, specifically how organizations can incorporate a responsibility and sustainability focus in their management development programs. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={As capitalist economies have shifted their primary focus from providing goods and services for all, to concentrating wealth at the top echelons of societies, social entrepreneurs have been one source of re-capturing the original intent of capitalism. Social entrepreneurs have combined the efficiency and effectiveness of business organizations with the social concerns of many non-profit and governmental agencies. As a result, social entrepreneurship is viewed as having significant potential for alleviating many of the social ills we now face. To accomplish this mission, however, will require expansion of social enterprises beyond their current footprints. We explore alternate methods of expansion, scaling and replication, and then examine potential catalysts, which can enable social entrepreneurs to attain their goals of social improvement. The catalysts we identify are effectual logic, enhanced legitimacy through appropriate reporting metrics, and information technology. We conclude with two brief case studies that exemplify how these catalysts are currently working to enhance the effectiveness of social start-ups. © Springer 2010.},

We show how in the context of social movement activism, an effectual network pre-committed resources to an inchoate social enterprise to produce a material artefact because it embodied the moral values of network members. We develop a model of social enterprise emergence based on these findings. We theorize the role of material artefacts in effectuation theory and suggest that, in the case, the artefact served as a boundary object, present in multiple social words and triggering commitment from actors not governed by hierarchical arrangements. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.},

abstract={Social enterprise is a contested concept which has become a site for policy intervention in many countries. In the UK the government has invested significant resources into social enterprise infrastructure, partly to increase the capacity of social enterprises to deliver or replace public services. Government publications show the number of social enterprises to have increased from 5,300 to 62,000 over a five-year period. This paper explores the myth of social enterprise growth in the UK through a methodological critique of the four government data sources used to construct and legitimise this myth. Particular attention is paid to how political decisions influence the construction of evidence. We find that growth is mainly attributable to political decisions to reinterpret key elements of the social enterprise definition and to include new organisational types in sampling frames. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={This article develops an "ordonomic" approach to business ethics in the age of globalization. Through the use of a three-tiered conceptual framework that distinguishes between the basic game of antagonistic social cooperation, the meta game of rule-setting, and the meta-meta game of rule-finding discourse, we address three questions, the answers to which we believe are crucial to fostering effective business leadership and corporate social responsibility. First, the purpose of business in society is value creation. Companies have a social mandate to organize mutually advantageous cooperation. Second, business ethics should teach the management competencies necessary to fulfill business's societal mandate. These competencies are optimization competence in the basic game of value creation, governance competence in the meta game of (political) rule setting, and the three discourse-related skills of orientation competence, reception competence, and communication competence necessary for engaging in the meta-meta game. Third, companies can help solve global problems through global corporate citizenship if they participate as political and moral actors in rule-setting processes and rule-finding discourse aimed at laying the foundation for value creation on a global scale. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

A random-effects meta-analysis of zero-order correlations reported in the findings of 31 studies (37 samples, n = 14,318) was performed, and correlations between the constructs in the TPB model and SEI were scrutinized through the application of meta-analytic structural equation modeling (MASEM) based on a pooled correlation matrix. Two alternative models were proposed and then evaluated, suggesting alternative formulations of the antecedents of SEI by modifying the relationships between key TPB constructs and intentions. The findings showed better fit of the alternative models than the original TPB model at predicting SEI. The findings also revealed that the strength of the two models enriches the TPB through the additional factors. We recommend that scholars adopt this technique when synthesizing evidence across assessments of TPB. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Interest in social innovations (SIs) from both the academic and the policy side is growing. Nonetheless, we still know little about which sustainable development goals (SDGs) SIs already address. Furthermore, only little is known about who the innovators developing and implementing SIs are. In this paper, we aim to bring more clarity and structure to the field of SIs. Firstly, a systematic literature review was conducted, before a content analysis was used to analyze the definitions used with regard to similarities. Secondly, all case studies described in the reviewed articles were then further systematically analyzed in order to identify the social or environmental problems addressed and the innovators involved. For the purpose of classifying the diverse types of problems, we used the globally known and broadly accepted 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs). Results showed that most SI case studies deal with an improvement of health and well-being. Furthermore, our study illustrates that there is a pronounced difference in the focus of SIs between developing and developed countries. Concerning the innovators, our results indicate that five types of innovators are fundamentally involved in developing and implementing SIs: social entrepreneurs, NGOs and non-profits, public institutions, civil society, firms, and social enterprises. Our definition analysis as well as the identification and classification of the innovators and addressed social needs bring much-needed clarity and structure to the field. However, our systematic review shows that SI is still in its infancy and it will be interesting to see where the field will head. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={Purpose: This paper aims to discuss hybrid organizations whose business models blur the boundary between for-profit and nonprofit worlds. With the aim of understanding how hybrid organizations have developed commercially viable business models to create positive social and environmental change, the authors contend that hybrids are altering long-held business norms and conceptions of the role of the corporation in society. Building on an analysis of the most updated literature on hybrid organizations and with the use of case study approach, the purpose of this paper is to derive managerial lessons that traditional businesses may apply to innovate their business models. Design/methodology/approach: This paper has a practical focus to help organizations to develop successful business strategies and design innovative business models. It applies emerging thinking on hybrid business models to provide new insights and ideas on the use of business models as tools for innovating and delivering value. To comply with this, first, the authors discuss the distinctive characteristics of hybrids and the hybrid business model through a concise but comprehensive review of all the literature on hybrid organization, which is still very recent. Second, we relied on a short case study that introduces information technology and digital innovation as the premises of the emergence of a new hybrid business model that adds additional elements to traditional business managers on how to learn from hybrid organizations’ avenues to innovate their business models. Findings: In this paper, the authors aimed to shed light on the management of any organization or initiative that aims to embrace multiple and competing yet potentially synergistic goals, as is increasingly the case in modern corporations. Spotting hidden complementarities of antagonistic assets can be arduous, time-consuming, costly and risky, but businesses driven by innovation may want to keep a close eye on the expanding hybrid sector as a source of future entrepreneurial opportunities. To this regard, hybrid social ventures have the potential to shed light on ways to innovate traditional business models. The essence of studying hybrids is that firms may learn how to innovate their business models in ways that go beyond current conceptualizations, making their mission profitable, rather than making profit their only mission! The research design (literature analysis and case study) allowed the authors to disentangle different innovative business models that hybrids suggest highlight strengths and weaknesses of such business models, understand strategies and capabilities associated with hybrids and transpose all these lessons learned to traditional business managers who constantly struggle for innovation. Research limitations/implications: The main implication is that hybrid organizations may serve as incubators for new practices that can gain scale and impact by infusion into existing corporations. The authors can assist to a process of “hybridization” of incumbent firms, pushing the boundaries of corporate sustainability efforts toward strategies in which profit and social purpose share more equal footing. Practical implications: Firms interested in benefiting from antagonistic assets that can have a dramatic impact on their business model innovation may want to consider some lessons: firms can attempt to build antagonistic assets into their mission, asking themselves what activities they can undertake with the potential to create (or erode) social, environmental and economic value and how these activities might be mediated by the context/environment in which they operate; they can partner with hybrids to benefit from them and absorb competencies from them, so to increase their likelihood to generate value-creating activities and to impact on wider range of stakeholders, including funders, partners, beneficiaries and communities; they can mimic hybrids on how to innovate their business model through the use of the “deliberate resource misfit” dynamic capability, mitigating negative impacts and trade-offs and maximizing positive value spillovers, both for the firms themselves and for the community. Social implications: Sharing know-how with hybrids opens up to ways to innovate business models, and hybrids are much more open to sharing lessons and encouraging others to copy their approaches in a genuine open innovation approach. Originality/value: The main lesson businesses can take away from studying hybrids is that antagonistic assets – and not only profitable complementary ones, as the resource-based view would suggest – do not have to be a burden on profits. Hybrids ground their strategy first and foremost on their beneficiaries, thus dealing with a bundle of antagonistic assets. The primary objective of hybrids is thus to find imaginative ways of generating profits from their given resources rather than acquiring the resources that generate the highest profit. Profit is the ultimate goal of traditional businesses’ mission, but by making profit their only mission, firms risk missing out on the hidden opportunities latent in antagonistic assets. Learning from hybrids about how to align profits and societal impact may be a driver of long-term competitive advantage. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The results provide robust support for the positive effect of the NIS on rural economic growth, and this positive relationship varies across the coastal and interior regions of China. The idea of this perspective piece is, the positive impact is stronger for high levels of labor mobility and R&D expenditure, especially for rural areas in China. © 2016},

We do this as an attempt to intensify the presence of the social and sociality in today's discourse on the entrepreneurship-society relationship. SE, as all entrepreneurship practices, operates by social and economic forces (limiting ourselves to those here), and generates social and economic outcomes (amongst others). Its second half, however, dominates the concept of SE, and our analysis seek to remedy this imbalance by focusing on the social productivity of entrepreneurship, on entrepreneurship desiring social change. We suggest 'public entrepreneurship' might grasp this as a more balanced concept that will also support a more precise analysis of the entrepreneurship-society relationship. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={In the face of global environmental change, a key question for the social sciences is how to organize the co-evolution of societies and their natural environment. In this context, a new long-term research program, the Earth System Governance Project, proposes several key issues to be examined: architecture, agency, adaptiveness, accountability, and allocation and access. The contributions to this special issue have focused on the analytical problem of agency. For example, they have examined newly emerging or understudied agents of global environmental governance, or offered a fresh assessment of agency in the context of existing governance mechanisms such as the Clean Development Mechanism. This concluding article outlines several insights provided by the contributions to this special issue regarding four key questions underlying the study of agency in global environmental governance. First, they call attention to the ingredients or processes that characterize agency in the first place and thus distinguish actors from agents. Secondly, the authors highlight the differences among agents and how they interact with each other. Thirdly, they point toward variation in the ways that agents may acquire authority. Finally, the contributions to this special issue suggest that there may be several approaches to evaluating agency, with different consequences. Thus, taken together, the contributions to this special issue provide a starting point for broadening our understanding of agency in earth system governance. © 2011 The Author(s).},

abstract={In response to societal grand challenges, professors have unique opportunities to effect change, repurposing their expertise to deploy relevant, timely, practical, and research-backed knowledge for the betterment of communities. Drawing on scholarship on postcrisis organizing, entrepreneurial hustle, and social entrepreneurship, we provide a firsthand, real-time case description of a three-day “virtual idea blitz” organized in response to the COVID-19 crisis. The event was organized and executed in less than a week and ultimately involved 200 individuals, including entrepreneurs, coders, medical doctors, venture capitalists, industry professionals, students, and professors from around the world. By the end of the weekend, 21 ideas with corresponding pitches were developed in five thematic areas: health needs, education, small businesses, community, and purchasing. We describe how the community was rapidly rallied, and we discuss the key learning outcomes of this spontaneous entrepreneurial endeavor. We provide evidence from participants and mentors that showcases the value of the time-compressed virtual idea blitz in accelerating social entrepreneurial action. We offer practical guidance to academic, community, and professional institutions that would like to replicate or build upon our approach to stimulate the formation of community and to coordinate efforts to thwart the ongoing threat of COVID-19, as well as other societal challenges that might emerge in the future. © 2020 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University},

abstract={Objectives: HIV self-testing (HIVST) offers an opportunity to increase HIV testing among people not reached by facility-based services. However, the promotion of HIVST is limited as a consequence of insufficient community engagement. We built a social entrepreneurship testing (SET) model to promote HIVST linkage to care among Chinese men who have sex with men (MSM) in Guangzhou. Methods: The SET model includes a few key steps. Each participant first completed an online survey, and paid a US$23 (refundable) deposit to receive an HIVST kit and a syphilis self-testing (SST) kit. After the testing, the results were sent to the platform by the participants and interpreted by Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) staff. Meanwhile, the deposit was returned to each participant. Finally, the Community based organizations (CBO) contacted the participants to provide counselling services, confirmation testing and linkage to care. Results: During April−June 2015, a total of 198 MSM completed a preliminary survey and purchased self-testing kits. The majority were aged < 34 years (84.4%) and met partners online (93.1%). In addition, 68.9% of participants had ever been tested for HIV, and 19.5% had ever performed HIVST. Overall, feedback was received from 192 participants (97.0%). Of these participants, 14 people did not use the kits; among those who did use the kits, the HIV and syphilis prevalences were 4.5% (eight of 178) and 3.7% (six of 178), respectively. All of the screened HIV-positive individuals sought further confirmation testing and were linked to care. Conclusions: Using an online SET model to promote HIV and syphilis self-testing among Chinese MSM is acceptable and feasible, and this model adds a new testing platform to the current testing service system. © 2016 British HIV Association},

abstract={To date, little attention has been given to the impact of big data in the Global South, about 60% of whose residents are below the poverty line. Big data manifests in novel and unprecedented ways in these neglected contexts. For instance, India has created biometric national identities for her 1.2 billion people, linking them to welfare schemes, and social entrepreneurial initiatives like the Ushahidi project that leveraged crowdsourcing to provide real-time crisis maps for humanitarian relief. While these projects are indeed inspirational, this article argues that in the context of the Global South there is a bias in the framing of big data as an instrument of empowerment. Here, the poor, or the "bottom of the pyramid" populace are the new consumer base, agents of social change instead of passive beneficiaries. This neoliberal outlook of big data facilitating inclusive capitalism for the common good sidelines critical perspectives urgently needed if we are to channel big data as a positive social force in emerging economies. This article proposes to assess these new technological developments through the lens of databased democracies, databased identities, and databased geographies to make evident normative assumptions and perspectives in this under-examined context. © 2016 Payal Aora.},

By applying population ecology, resource dependency and resource-based view perspectives, this paper develops a conceptual model to provide greater insight into how social entrepreneurship ventures collaborate with other organizations in a network to fulfill resource requirements. Through this process social ventures address unmet social needs to create value which leads to the development and growth of individuals, communities, and regions. Using a large city's economic development actors involved in small business promotion as test cases, this exploratory study illustrates that social ventures effectively acquire resources from the primary social engagement network actors: corporations, governments, and other social ventures. The framework introduced in the paper provides a means by which to better understand the context in which relevant social engagement players in a network exist and the synergies that they can develop. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Purpose – The research fields of service innovation and social innovation have, until now, been largely disconnected. At the most basic level, a great many social innovations are services, often public sector services with social entrepreneurs organizing and delivering service innovations. As well as this overlap in the focus of research, scholars in both research fields address socio-economic concerns using multidisciplinary perspectives. The purpose of this paper is to provide a framework that can bridge the two research fields. Design/methodology/approach – Inter-linkages between service and social innovation are shown by identifying research areas in which both find a joint heuristic field. This approach has been illustrated in a set of case studies in the health sector in Europe. Findings – The bridge between social innovation and service innovation research can be built when social innovation is examined through a multi-agent framework. The authors focus on social innovations where the co-creation of novel services is guided by the prominent position taken by citizens, social entrepreneurs or third sector organizations (NGOs or charities) in the innovation process. Of particular interest are the ways in which the interests of individual users and citizens are “represented” by third sector organizations. Practical implications – The case study of the Austrian nationwide public access defibrillation programme provides an exemplar of the process of co-creation by which this social innovation was developed, implemented and sustained. Here the Austrian Red Cross acted on behalf of citizens, organizing an innovation network capable of creating both the demand and the supply side of a sustainable market for the production and safe application of portable automated external defibrillators (AEDs) in Austria. This process involved, first, raising public awareness of the need for portable defibrillators and acting as a user representative when inducing changes in the design of portable AEDs. Later, there was the institutionalization of AED training in every first aid training in Austria, work with local manufacturers to produce this device, and with large user organizations to install AEDs on their premises. Originality/value – The paper develops multi-agent model of innovation that enables one to synthesize key concepts in social and service innovation literatures and, thereby, examine the dynamics of invention and diffusion of social innovations. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The recent emergence of new venture philanthropists, social entrepreneurs and neoliberal policy advocates and the new ways in which they configure and perform their political agendas have brought important changes in the way in which education policy is enacted. This study takes some of the ideas sketched in previous work further and develops what was termed there as 'philanthropic governance'. The first section analyses the transition to a new political framework characterised by new forms of coordination or 'heterarchies'. These transformations represent new forms of governmentality and power regimes and are deeply rooted within the political economy and political philosophy of neoliberalism. The second section of the study focuses on a set of new policy actors, the 'new' philanthropists and explores the organisational model of a group of these philanthropic individuals and enterprises, their discourses, connections, ideological influences and agendas on the ground. Finally, the study reflects on the new ways through which philanthropic activity has gained an increasingly important political dimension, becoming a central explanatory variable to understand the recent changes and directions of national and international political agendas in different parts of the world. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.},

This study contributes to answer the call for more quantitative research and simultaneously argues that, despite the potential contribution of large-scale data, the validity and reliability of measurement instruments cannot be seen independently from their particular context. With this important observation in mind, our findings indicate a predominance of younger social organizations or initiatives that rely to a great extent on government funding, whereas earned income is limited. Furthermore, social entrepreneurs show less ambition in terms of employment growth and progression to more mature stages of the entrepreneurial process compared with commercial entrepreneurs. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Prosocial crowdfunding platforms are venues for individual lenders to allocate resources to ventures that specifically pursue economic and social value. In a setting where hybridity is expected, do crowdfunders respond positively to category-spanning ventures, or do they prefer to fund ventures that are more clearly situated within a single category? Drawing on theory rooted in category membership and spanning, our hypotheses test whether prosocial crowdfunding lenders will more quickly allocate resources to hybrid microenterprises that communicate their hybridity, or to those that communicate a single one of their dual aims. Our study demonstrates that even in such a setting, crowdfunders lend more quickly to microenterprises that position themselves within a single linguistic category in which the social is emphasized over the economic. This suggests that how hybrid organizations position themselves in their linguistic narratives has a significant impact on resource allocation by external prosocial audiences. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={At a time of global economic and environmental crisis, academic and policy debates are re-emphasizing the potential of the social economy in providing an alternative development model that reconnects communities with their resource-base and enhances their 'resilience'. The goal of this paper is to explore this potential through a focus on the practices and values of those who are concretely involved in the social economy. Based on data collected on five community food enterprises in Oxfordshire, UK, the analysis focuses on the perceptions of social entrepreneurs in relation to the 'alternativeness' of the social economy, its potential for expansion and its resilience. The research highlights the capacity of social entrepreneurs to empower local communities through a process of collective mobilization of local resources. Theoretically, this study generates new insights into the nature and meanings of resilience as a process of creation of more self-reliant communities of people, places, tools, skills and knowledge. From a policy and practice perspective, the paper raises the need for regional development strategies that capture the gains of these isolated initiatives, particularly in relation to their innovative capacity to create a shared vision that fosters synergies between local ecological, social and economic resources. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={This article looks at social entrepreneurs that operate for-profit and internationally, offering that international for-profit social entrepreneurs (IFPSE) are of a unique type. Initially, this article utilizes the entrepreneurship, social entrepreneurship, and international entrepreneurship literatures to develop a definition of the IFPSE. Next, a proposed model of the IFPSE is built utilizing the dimensions of mindset, opportunity recognition, social networks, and outcomes. Case studies of three IFPSE are then used to examine the proposed model. In the final section, findings from the case studies are used to examine the proposed model and more fully elucidate the dimensions of the IFPSE. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={Social entrepreneurship is an increasingly important concept in the study of voluntary and nonprofit organizations. In spite of the growing recognition of this concept, little is known about what individual characteristics might describe or explain who in society is likely to be (or become) a social entrepreneur. This preliminary study empirically addresses this question using data from a United States online panel. Our results suggest that social entrepreneurs are likely to be female, non-white, younger, and college-educated individuals with some business experience and who live in big cities. Social entrepreneurs also tend to have more social capital, as measured by their activity in clubs and organizations other than work, and they are more likely to be happy, interested in politics, extroverted, giving (to charity), and liberal ideologically. Although exploratory, these findings help describe the social entrepreneur and suggest ways in which this important actor in civil society can be better identified, understood, and perhaps cultivated. © International Society for Third-Sector Research and The John's Hopkins University 2009.},

abstract={In contemporary societies an increasing number of social needs have to be financed by market activities. In this regard, scholars started to discuss whether ‘Social Innovation’, ‘Social Entrepreneurship’, ‘CSR’, ‘Social Enterprise’, ‘Enterprising Nonprofits’, and ‘Social Business’ are able to provide solutions for financially sustainable social services. Just how these so-called Hybrid Organizations balance the tension between social and economic issues still requires conceptualization. This paper introduces the following definition based on the literature on organizational identity, civil society, and marketized nonprofits: Hybrids are characterized by an organizational identity that systematically integrates civil society and markets, exchange communal solidarity for financial and non-financial resources, calculate the market value of communal solidarity, and trade this solidarity for financial and nonfinancial resources. In other words they “Create Functional Solidarity”. Criteria to empirically observe Hybrid Organizations are also introduced and compared to similar concepts. The paper concludes with an outline of a research agenda. © 2013, International Society for Third-Sector Research and The Johns Hopkins University.},

abstract={The purpose of this study is to cast new light on possible gender biases in implicit theories people hold about various forms of entrepreneurial activity. Using social role theory, we delve into sex-role stereotypes associated with high- and low-growth entrepreneurship and commercial and social entrepreneurship. Predictions were tested with an experimental design using both a between-subject design to capture group-level stereotypes and a within-subject design to capture individual-level stereotypes. Findings reveal that commercial and high-growth entrepreneurs are perceived as more similar to men than to women and higher on agency than communality. Conversely, low-growth entrepreneurs are perceived as more similar to women than men, and higher on communality than agency. Social entrepreneurs are uniquely perceived as similar to both men and women, though they are also considered higher on agency than communality. Interestingly, female, but not male respondents, perceive some overlap between the feminine gender role and high-growth and commercial entrepreneurship. Notably, those higher on modern sexism perceive less overlap between entrepreneurship and femininity. Taken together, our results suggest that commercial high-growth entrepreneurship is most strongly male-typed, which is likely to be problematic for women (and non-traditional men) wanting to start growth-oriented ventures.

abstract={Despite widespread and growing public interest in sustainability certifications, many social entrepreneurs have opted not to obtain such certification. Drawing on recent studies highlighting the salience of both gender and context in shaping differences among social enterprises, we develop an identity-based framework for explaining heterogeneity in the adoption of sustainability certification. We test our ideas using a sample of 1251 U.S. firms obtained from B Lab, the organization responsible for assessing Certified B Corporations. Our results show that woman-owned businesses are twice as likely to qualify for certification and more than three times as likely to certify. Moreover, this propensity to certify is amplified in contexts where sustainability norms are weak, mimetic pressure to obtain sustainability certification is low, and woman-owned businesses are less prevalent. These findings support our central theoretical argument that certification differences are due to actors’ efforts to engage in identity work, strengthening their sense of self-coherence and distinctiveness by way of this authentication process. We conclude by highlighting our contributions to existing scholarship on social entrepreneurship, identity work, and certification adoption, as well as strategic implications for B Lab. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

The debate on the evaluation of the socio-economic impact generated by this kind of organization has gone hand in hand with the growth of social entrepreneurship. This study provides an exploratory analysis of the emerging practice of measuring the socio-economic impact of social enterprises using the theoretic construct called "Blended Value Accounting" (BVA). Among the models and tools proposed by BVA, we examine in particular the Social Return on Investment (SROI)-an instrument of causal contribution analysis-conducting a literature review on its application to the evaluation of socio-economic impact of social enterprises and on its implications for BVA. Finally, we reach a conclusion as to the role that these tools of mixed accounting and assessment might play-particularly the one examined-with respect to the positivist, critical, and interpretative theories of accounting, thus identifying the areas for further research. © 2012 International Society for Third-Sector Research and The Johns Hopkins University.},

abstract={This paper aims to explore how social capital is leveraged in social innovations to overcome resource constraints. The paper reports on the findings from an exploratory study on the social innovation process within Indian social entrepreneurial ventures (SEVs) developed in a resource constrained environment. This study adopts an interpretive case study approach to investigating social innovation that enables researchers to identify the cultural contexts within which social entrepreneurship emerges. Views of the social entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs were gathered through semi-structured interviews and observations. Findings of the study demonstrated that there are distinctive stages of the social innovation process. The stages of the process are initial phase: emergence of a social idea for a venture; development phase: building the social venture; and scaling phase: growing the social venture. These stages of the process lead to the identification of social needs as social entrepreneurial opportunities, then to the initiation, development and scaling of conjectured solutions generating economic and social value. During the development stage of the social innovation, closer relationships with investors could help access scarce financial resources. Finally, in the scaling phase, greater involvement with the target beneficiaries can help reduce marketing and search-related costs for SEVs. Thus, greater engagement of beneficiaries throughout the social innovation process can help in the successful initiation, development and scaling of a social innovation. First, this study identifies the distinctive stages of the social innovation process. Second, this study provides empirical evidence to support previous claims that social innovations develop in resource-constrained environments. Finally, this exploratory research has investigated social innovations in a developing country context India. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

abstract={Until recently, it was commonly assumed that social enterprises – by virtue of the ingenuity of their founders – were extra-ordinarily capable to simultaneously pursue social and financial goals. However, an emerging body of literature considers that social enterprises face tensions and trade-offs as they pursue their divergent goals. While extant research has offered insights into tensions that social enterprises face between social and financial goals, it is not clear whether this is the only trade-off social enterprises face or whether they also have to balance other, related tensions that stem from their social mission. In case tensions and trade-offs manifest themselves in other ways too, how do social enterprises manage the various different tensions and trade-offs while keeping a coherent social mission? The aim of this study is to examine a social enterprise's balancing act of addressing the various different tensions and trade-offs that arise when trying to deliver a multifaceted but coherent social mission. A qualitative research design was employed to examine tensions and trade-offs by focusing on the case of a German social enterprise from the organic food sector. The case study findings suggest that, initially, social enterprises face social-financial tensions. Yet, as they grow in size and scope, they also begin to experience tensions among their various social goals that we refer to as social mission design tensions. Regarding the management of tensions, we find that in contrast to the current tenor in the social enterprise literature, which espouses that redressing tensions is essentially an act of separation or integration of social and financial goals, we find that, at times, social enterprises accept and live with tensions instead of addressing them. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

Yet only scant attention has been paid to where that change happens. We suggest that a community level of analysis is essential for understanding the extra-organizational settings implied by the “social” in “social entrepreneurship.” We adopt a UNESCO-inspired community typology including geographical communities, communities of interest or solidarity, communities of identity, and intentional communities as an organizing framework. Relying on a wealth creation perspective, we evaluate the social change that takes place by assessing four different types of capital created within communities—physical capital, financial capital, human capital, and social capital. Based on a review of 57 peer-reviewed journals and 8 leading case study outlets, we find that examples of all four community types and all four capital types are evident in the SE literature. We discuss the implications of the community as a locus of SE activity and capital as an indicator of social impact in future research. © 2017 International Council for Small Business},

One explanation for this may be the continuing lack of an appropriate scale measuring social entrepreneurship orientation (SEO). The purpose of this paper is to address this research gap by proposing an initial SEO scale based on input from scholars in the fields of entrepreneurship and social entrepreneurship. Design/methodology/approach: This study employed mixed methods and a two stage design. In stage 1, a Delphi study with 18 researchers with expertise of investigating entrepreneurship and social entrepreneurship was used to generate constructs combining aspects of both social and EOs. In stage 2, the authors assessed the face validity of the derived items from the Delphi study by conducting a survey with 82 such experts. Findings: This paper provides fresh empirical insights into how SEO can be measured by proposing, for the first time, a 12 item scale with four dimensions for the first time. Research limitations/implications: The authors recommend that future studies employ quantitative methods, particularly with firms exhibiting differing levels of the “socialness” dimension which the authors propose and that such studies involve a variety of research informants. Statistical analysis of data collected across large sample sizes will help evaluate the reliability and validity of the scale which the authors propose. Practical implications: This paper includes implications for future research based on the proposed SEO measurement scale. Originality/value: This paper develops the first SEO scale based on empirical data collected from experts in the fields of entrepreneurship and social entrepreneurship. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose – Urban farming is becoming more common in the USA, as food-based entrepreneurs seek to make money farming in the city. Yet many urban farms are concerned with other factors in addition to food production, and thus have incorporated social goals into their missions. The purpose of this paper is to identify the social missions of urban farms in the USA, their extent, and explores differences and similarities among farms with varying missions. Design/methodology/approach – The authors use primary data collected from a 2012 national survey of urban farmers in the USA. In total, 35 questions, covering the 2012 farm year, targeted production and marketing practices, risks and challenges, information and technical assistance needs, farm size and location, age of primary farmer, and farm characteristics. A multinomial logistic model was used to analyze the social missions of urban farms in the sample. Findings – The authors find that food production is an essential part of the mission for all urban farms. Some farms have social missions, as well, which the survey results indicate are related to food security, education, and community building. The authors find that all urban farms, regardless of their mission, are relatively small and face similar challenges in terms of providing the primary farmer with a living. Farms with explicit social missions, relative to those with a strict market orientation, donate a higher share of food from their farm and are less likely to own farmland. Urban farms located in with lower median income are more likely to have social goals related to building community or improving security food security. Originality/value – Urban agriculture is becoming more prevalent in many developed nations. At the same time, social entrepreneurship is gaining traction. Given the limited ability of urban farms in terms of food production, the social mission of urban farms arises as a possible explanation for the recent growth. This paper provides insight into a new phenomenon, and uses new data to provide insight into size, types of farms, and farmer well-being and address the social missions of urban farms in the USA. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

However, another piece of the theoretical jigsaw requires understanding how this type of innovation is enacted by organisations. This article looks at the means by which not-for-profit ventures pursuing socially innovative activities develop the necessary capabilities to innovate. The multidimensional theoretical construct of absorptive capacity and the evolutionary economics concept of organisational routines are used to analyse 14 case studies of innovative not-for-profit ventures in Australia and the UK. The results show that these organisations have a unique mediating function in the social innovation process by configuring internal and external absorptive capacity routines to combine user and technological knowledge flows. The article concludes by proposing some research directions for those taking forward the study of social innovation. © The Author(s) 2012.},

abstract={Over the past 10 years the sales of Fair Trade goods - particularly those carrying the Fair Trade Labelling Organizations International (FLO) certification mark - have grown exponentially. Academic interest in Fair Trade has also grown significantly over the past decade with researchers analysing the model from a wide range of theoretical perspectives. Whilst Fair Trade is generally acknowledged as a new supply chain model, it has tended to be studied at the micro/organisational level rather than at the macro/systems level. As a consequence, its wider impact as institutional innovation at the field level appears to have been under-theorised so far. In order to address this research gap, this article uses a neoinstitutionalist perspective to analyse Fair Trade not simply as a new exchange model working within existing organisational and economic structures, but rather as an agent of institutional entrepreneurship at, and beyond, the field level. From this latter perspective, Fair Trade brings a new set of transformational meanings to extant exchange and consumption models and reforms fields of economic exchange by disrupting and then re-assembling key institutional elements around modern consumption to roll back commodity fetishism and reconnect consumers and producers. The type of institutional change driven by Fair Trade can be seen as a form of social entrepreneurship. © Springer 2010.},

abstract={Purpose: Social enterprises are not purely commercial and philanthropic. They represent a hybrid form of organizations that involve taking business-like, innovative approaches to deliver public services. Very little research has investigated the role of intellectual capital (IC) in innovation processes in social enterprises. This paper aims to address this. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses a critical analysis of current literature in relation to the IC concept within the social enterprise context. Findings: The paper argues that the IC concept can be utilized as a strategic management framework that assists social enterprises to harness knowledge for the pursuit of innovative social and commercial activities. Research limitations/implications: The paper contributes to the literature by theoretically arguing that IC can be utilized in innovation processes in social enterprises. It also informs social entrepreneurs that the IC concept is a valid strategic management framework that assists facilitating innovation in social enterprises. An IC conceptual framework is proposed using theoretical arguments from the literature. The framework helps social entrepreneurs to visualize IC and its components in their organizations for the development of effective innovation-based strategies in social enterprises. The increased awareness of the IC concept in social enterprises, as a result of this paper, is likely to generate further research from both non-profit practitioners and scholars. Originality/value: The paper is considered as a starting-point and serves as a milestone in examining the role of IC in innovation processes in social enterprises. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={In social entrepreneurship, social and economic missions co-exist in a tensioned balance. At times, business survival requires reprioritizing objectives, leading social entrepreneurs to drift away from social values in pursuit of commercial gains. This requires (re)balancing acts aimed at mitigating the effects of drift. Although critical for business survival, the micro antecedents of this balancing act remain uncovered. This study explores the complex interactions between the strategic conditions of social entrepreneurs in the development of market-oriented social missions. Drawing on a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis of 111 social entrepreneurs in Chile, this study reveals four alternative combinations of strategic conditions that explain why the social mission of a social entrepreneur can be perceived as being valuable for achieving a competitive advantage. The findings contribute to a more complex understanding of the set of conditions involved in the balancing act between social and economic missions in social entrepreneurship. This study calls into question the binary assumption underlying the commitment of social entrepreneurs to their social mission. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

In a departure from most previous studies that consider those at the bottom either as potential consumers or as recipients of aid, we look at grassroots entrepreneurs. Despite extremely challenging conditions, they are able to assemble resources and to combine and align principles of business strategy and social value creation to effect important economic and social change. Using a resource based view lens, we redirect the spotlight onto the individual entrepreneur in social entrepreneurship and extend the study of bricolage to that field. We rely on inductive methodology applied to eight cases to unpack the resource assembly process of such entrepreneurs, revealing distinctive features of bricolage such as the setting aside of cultural norms, the rejigging of domain-specific skills, and the use of spare time. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Social entrepreneurs formally or informally generate community associations and networking that produces social outcomes. Social entrepreneurship is a relatively new and poorly understood concept. Policy promotes generating community activity, particularly in rural areas, for health and social benefits and 'community resilience'. Rural health professionals might be well placed to generate community activity due to their status and networks. This exploratory study, conducted in rural Tasmania and the Highlands and Islands of Scotland considered whether rural health professionals act as social entrepreneurs. We investigated activities generated and processes of production. Thirty-eight interviews were conducted with general practitioners, community nurses, primary healthcare managers and allied health professionals living and working rurally. Interviewees were self-selecting responders to an invitation for rural health professionals who were 'formally or informally generating community associations or networking that produced social outcomes'. We found that rural health professionals initiated many community activities with social outcomes, most related to health. Their identification of opportunities related to knowledge of health needs and examples of initiatives seen elsewhere. Health professionals described ready access to useful people and financial resources. In building activities, health professionals could simultaneously utilise skills and knowledge from professional, community member and personal dimensions. Outcomes included social and health benefits, personal 'buzz' and community capacity. Health professionals' actions could be described as social entrepreneurship: identifying opportunities, utilising resources and making 'deals'. They also align with community development. Health professionals use contextual knowledge to envisage and grow activities, indicating that, as social entrepreneurs, they do not explicitly choose a social mission, rather they act within their known world-view. Policymakers could consider ways to engage rural health professionals as social entrepreneurs, in helping to produce resilient communities. Crown Copyright © 2009.},

Kennedy School of Government in collaboration with US News and World Report among America's 25 Best Leaders. Ashoka coined the term 'social entrepreneur'. Its first insight was that there was nothing more powerful than a big social idea, but only if it is in the hands of a first-class social entrepreneur. The organisation works as a social venture capital fund, helping selected 'Fellows' with start-up funds to launch their ideas. The Fellows' direct impact is only the beginning; they are role models who inspire others to become active Changemakers. Ashoka weaves them together into a global community whose collaborations are far more powerful than the sum of its solo practitioner parts. This paper examines the evolution of Ashoka, its role as a driver of social change, and the various collaborations and institutions it has helped build and is still in the process of building to promote social entrepreneurship. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

We identify four strategic responses to institutional complexity: appropriation, integration, differentiation, and working-through. These strategies enable reaching out to a broader range of stakeholders.

The paper offers a conceptualisation of the possible associations between Hofstede’s cultural dimensions and social entrepreneurial activity as defined by the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, along with its empirical testing across more than 40 countries around the world. Based on correlation analysis that was controlled for the countries’ level of economic development, there appears to be a negative association between the national power distance level and social entrepreneurial activity. In addition, the rate of young social entrepreneurial ventures is associated with lower levels of masculinity. The cultural dimensions of individualism and uncertainty avoidance have no direct linear association with social entrepreneurial activities of any kind. In factor-driven economies, lower levels of masculinity appear to support the development of social entrepreneurship. On the other hand, in innovation-driven economies, social entrepreneurial ventures emerge more often in those cultures characterised by shortterm orientation and indulgence. © 2017 The Author(s).},

It views both social entrepreneurship and conflict engagement through a social constructionist lens and employs theory building methods from action research and programme theory evaluation. The argument is presented in the form of a 'programme theory of action', called the 'Studio for Social Creativity' that provides the conceptual and practical basis for promoting development in Israel's northern periphery, a region characterized by socio-economic stagnation as well as deep social divisions, especially between Jewish and Arab Palestinian inhabitants. The programme theory of action includes a description of the context, the problem framing, underlying assumptions, action strategies and intended outcomes. It hypothesizes that integrating social entrepreneurship and conflict engagement impacts regional development by redefining inter-group relationships, enhancing social networks, activating social capital, leveraging diversity and challenging existing power structures. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Drawing on capital theory and institutional theory, we hypothesize the contingent role of a country's formal institutions (financial, educational, and political) on the relationship between individual capital (financial, human and social capital) and social entrepreneurship entry. Using the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor data, we find that all three forms of individual capital are important for social entrepreneurship entry. Moreover, we find that this relationship is contingent on the formal institutional context such that (i) philanthropy-oriented financial systems have a positive moderating effect on investment of financial capital; (ii) educational systems have a positive moderating effect on investment of human capital; and (iii) political systems have a positive moderating effect on investment of both human and financial capital. We make substantial contributions to the literature on social entrepreneurship by ascertaining the nature of contingent effects of formal institutions on the relationship between individual capital and the emergence of social enterprises. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

To meet these needs, nurses are being encouraged to practice to the full extent of their skills and take significant leadership roles in health policy, planning, and provision. This can involve entrepreneurial or intrapreneurial roles. Although nurses form the largest group of health professionals, they are frequently restricted in their scope of practice. Nurses can help to improve health services in a cost effective way, but to do so, they must be seen as equal partners in health service provision. This article provides a global perspective on evolving nursing roles for innovation in health care. A historical overview of entrepreneurship and intrapreneurship is offered. Included also is discussion of a social entrepreneurship approach for nursing, settings for nurse entre/intrapreneurship, and implications for research and practice. © 2012 OJIN.},

abstract={Social entrepreneurship represents a new organizational form reflecting a time of societal change. The concept of social entrepreneurship has in recent years received an increased academic interest from the field of sport management. This review therefore aims to outline the scope and focus of, as well as theoretically position, the utilization of the concept of social entrepreneurship in the current body of peer-reviewed research within the field of sport and social entrepreneurship. Thirty-three English language peer-reviewed articles were selected and analyzed using Gartner's (1985) variables of entrepreneurship and three schools of thought within social entrepreneurship. The findings show that the scope of research into sport and social entrepreneurship is limited and that sport plays a minor role in the articles. The articles focus on the processes of social entrepreneurship, but the manner in which the concept of social entrepreneurship is used differs between articles and is seldom defined. These findings indicate that much can be done to better understand sport and social entrepreneurship. Emerging directions for future research are provided. © 2017 Human Kinetics, Inc.},

abstract={Social entrepreneurship, individual activities with a social objective, is used in this study as a conceptual tool for empirically examining farmers’ participation in alternative food networks (AFNs). This study verifies whether their participation is driven by the social entrepreneurship dimension to satisfy social and environmental needs. We develop a more inclusive view of how social entrepreneurship is present among farmers participating in AFNs by using a behavioural approach based on three main psychological constructs: attitude, objective, and behaviour. The empirical results show that two types of farmers participate in AFNs. One type is closer to commercial entrepreneurs; the main attitudes and objectives affecting their behaviour are oriented toward profit maximization and farm progress. The second type is closer to social entrepreneurial activity; the main objectives affecting their behaviour are oriented towards satisfying social and environmental needs. The study’s results offer implications and suggest recommendations concerning social entrepreneurial practices and the motivations of the farmers who participate in AFNs. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={In view of urgent social and environmental problems, it is important to understand the political dynamics that may promote sustainable development and to identify the agents that make changes in this direction happen. We examine the role and authority of a new type of actor that has recently emerged on the global stage-the social entrepreneur, who tackles social and ecological problems with entrepreneurial means. We consider them as agents that perform functions and provide services that have been considered to be the sole authority of states. For instance, the provision of water services has long been considered an exclusive task of the state. The water sector therefore serves as a good example to explore how these agents come up with their own missions and political agendas. Via an illustrative sample of social entrepreneurs from around the world, we explore their relation to water governance in general and the hydraulic mission in particular. We propose that their innovative potential serves as their main source of authority. Their local embeddedness along with their educational efforts, participatory goals, and accreditation as "social entrepreneur" provide additional sources of authority. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={Philanthropic venture capital (PhVC) is a financing option available for social enterprises that, like traditional venture capital, provides capital and value-added services to portfolio organizations. Differently from venture capital, PhVC has an ethical dimension as it aims at maximizing the social return on the investment. This article examines the deal structuring phase of PhVC investments in terms of instrument used (from equity to grant), valuation, and covenants included in the contractual agreement. By content analyzing a set of semi-structured interviews and thereafter surveying the entire population of PhVC funds that are active in Europe and in the United States, findings indicate that the non-distribution constraint holding for non-profit social enterprises is an effective tool to align the interests of both investor and investee. This makes the investor behaving as a steward rather than as a principal. Conversely, while backing non-profit social ventures, philanthropic venture capitalists structure their deal similarly as traditional venture capital, as the absence of the non-distribution constraint makes such investments subject to moral hazard risk both in terms of perks and stealing and social impact focus. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Findings: The paper finds traces of the legitimacy issues in the literature on non-profits and, based on this, argue that a new institutional domain is being constructed. The paper concludes that in this new domain not only is the use of market-based initiatives seen as a legitimate means of funding a social mission, but also it has now become the normative way and one that is promoted by consultants and foundations concerned with social entrepreneurs and their initiatives.

abstract={Concern about environmental problems has led to more attention being paid to the sustainable development objective. Social entrepreneurship, and entrepreneurship in general, show a direct relationship with this objective, due mainly to the activities carried out by entrepreneurs regarding the development of new products, the search for new markets, and the introduction of innovations. Because of this, it is important to identify the variables that influence both types of entrepreneurship to adequately design measures to stimulate sustainable development through these activities. These variables can be grouped into two groups: sociocultural factors and economic factors. The objective of this paper is to analyze the behavior of these two groups over general entrepreneurship and social entrepreneurship, in addition to the impact of these two types of entrepreneurship on sustainable development. To carry out this analysis, we have developed an empirical analysis with structural equations for the case of 15 OECD countries between 2015 and 2016. La preocupación por los problemas ambientales ha llevado a que se preste más atención al objetivo de desarrollo sostenible. El emprendimiento social, y el emprendimiento en general, muestran una relación directa con este objetivo, debido principalmente a las actividades llevadas a cabo por los emprendedores en relación con el desarrollo de nuevos productos, la búsqueda de nuevos mercados y la introducción de innovaciones. Debido a esto, es importante identificar las variables que influyen en ambos tipos de emprendimiento para diseñar adecuadamente medidas para estimular el desarrollo sostenible a través de estas actividades. Estas variables se pueden agrupar en dos grupos: factores socioculturales y factores económicos. El objetivo de este trabajo es analizar el comportamiento de estos dos grupos sobre el emprendimiento general y el emprendimiento social, además del impacto de estos dos tipos de emprendimiento en el desarrollo sostenible.

abstract={In recent years, the term social entrepreneur has become increasingly common in academic and business circles. Social entrepreneurs engage in a variety of activities, but always with the intention of solving social problems. Social entrepreneurs are not merely people who perform acts of charity; they have an evident desire to improve social well-being and develop projects with long-term vision. The creation of sustainable social value is a key characteristic that differentiates them from well-meaning individuals who simply engage in charitable works. There are, however, significant gaps in our understanding of social entrepreneurs and few empirical studies on the subject. This present study attempts to identify the characteristics of more socially oriented entrepreneurs, using sociodemographic variables and the theory of universal values toward work. Analysis of a sample of approximately 400 people shows that more than half of entrepreneurial orientation can be explained through the possession of the values of self-enhancement (with an inverse relationship in this case), self-transcendence, and conservation. The theory of universal values has proved extraordinarily useful for studying the characteristics of social entrepreneurs. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

While the MNCs have mainly had the technical knowledge and financial resources required, collaboration with NGOs have allowed them to learn about the BOP’s specific needs and benefit from the NGOs’ knowledge, human resources and good relationships in this market.
Originality/value: This research unravels how service firms can seize opportunities at the BOP. The authors build on social entrepreneurship theory and bring new insights to the field of international business. In addition, the authors broaden the network view and show how networking with social actors such as NGOs enables the mobilisation of resources, actors and activities in emerging markets.
Design/methodology/approach: This research adopts an exploratory approach employing qualitative multiple case studies. Three service firms that have targeted the BOP markets in India were studied. In total, 25 in-depth interviews were conducted with multinational corporations (MNCs) and their NGO partners. Data analysis was facilitated through pattern matching and systematic case comparison.
Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore how employing corporate social entrepreneurship and developing a network of relationships with non-governmental organisations (NGOs) can support and contribute towards the internationalisation of service firms into the base of the pyramid (BOP) markets in emerging markets. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={At the end of 2010, the British Museum unveiled the final artefact in their exhibition 'A History of the World in 100 Objects': a portable solar-powered lamp designed for and sold to people living without access to mains electricity in Africa and Asia. Solar-powered lights have become iconic objects of social entrepreneurship in Africa and Asia and this article explores the work involved in producing them as humanitarian goods. Following the 100th object from its conception in a Stanford University classroom to points of sale and use in rural India, the article explores how it has been made to materialise both an ethic of care and an ethic of commercial interest. Drawing from traditions in the social study of technology and the conceptual vocabulary of Michel Callon, the author argues that the significance of objects like the ultra-affordable solar lamp lies in their capacity to make and define markets at the 'bottom of the pyramid'. © The Author(s) 2013.},

To provide original perspectives on digital work we emphasize the agency of the producers and freelancers working at the global outsourcing firm Samasource and the cable television network Current TV. Our analyses of these two cases reveal important questions regarding 1) the values and organizational culture of firm founders and executives and 2) the mobility of freelance workers within the networks of digital labor. In conclusion we interrogate how wealth is distributed within the network.

We propose a dynamic model of responsible careers based on studying 32 individuals in the emerging organizational fields of corporate responsibility, social entrepreneurship, sustainability, and social investing. We describe six career practices - expressing self, connecting to others, constructing contribution, institutionalizing, field shaping, and engaging systemically. Observations suggest that development of these practices is influenced by four learning dynamics: people's perceptions of 'shifting landscapes' in which they seek to orient themselves, exploration and both biographical and systemic reflexivity. Our interdisciplinary and empirically grounded approach, integrating psychological intentions and institutional context, strengthens theorizing about responsible careers. The proposed model depicts responsible careers as continually evolving, sometimes precarious, and as dynamically enacted in relation to pluralist, shifting landscapes. © 2011 The Author(s).},

abstract={One of the roles of social entrepreneurship within a national system of innovation (NSI) is to generate and ensure effective adoption of innovations that address underserved needs. However, many such innovations do not achieve the expected social impact. Why? Our paper explores answers to this question by considering access to sanitation as a basic need and ‘toilets’ as an innovation for those who had no prior access to one. We trace the evolution of the Indian sanitation sector and then delve into the process of sanitation coverage in an Indian village. We show that demand for social entrepreneurship is being increasingly satisfied by third party sponsored social enterprises. However, there is systemic uncertainty about the efforts required to catalyze demand and strategic uncertainty about the social enterprise's capabilities and intentions. Long term impact is jointly determined by the true intention of the social enterprise, its capabilities and the nature of contextual challenges. Therefore, forecasting of social change should integrate the incentives within NSI for social entrepreneurship to make high-quality sustained social impact rather than short-lived ones. This will not only depend on the willingness to adopt, but also the monitoring systems, impact analysis and sustainability audits that social entrepreneurship is subject to. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

High costs of waste disposal, lack of government incentives or regulations governing service providers, and lack of awareness among consumers also contributed to solid food waste in Singapore. A survey with consumers recorded their habits with regard to planning food purchases, food wastage while cooking, and wastage during consumption of cooked, canned, and ready-to-eat products. A stepwise multiple discriminant analysis done on a key categorical variable “How much effort do you take to minimize amount of uneaten food you throw away?” yielded two groups that differed significantly along several attitudinal/behavioral dimensions. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.},

It contributes directly to the configurational approaches to HRM by identifying HRM systems that are used to manage various types of knowledge assets. First, we develop a framework from theory to categorise knowledge assets into human (industry and firm specific), social (entrepreneurial and co-operative) and organisational capital (mechanistic and organic). Within this framework, we draw on data gathered in the 12 professional services firms to understand how HR practices enable the management of each knowledge asset. We identify two configurations of HR practices (organisationally and professionally focused). These configurations do not exist in isolation but are used simultaneously by organisations via either a targeted (different practices in different parts of the organisation) or a temporally segregated way (different practices for the same group of employees over time). © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

The idea was to challenge existing concepts of the economy, the firm, and entrepreneurship in order to shed new light on social entrepreneurship and on our existing theoretical frameworks. The first two contributions use a macro-perspective and discuss the notion of adaptive societies and the tragedies of disharmonization, respectively. Taking a management perspective, the next two focus on the limits of conventional assumptions in management theory, particularly human capital theory and resource-based view. The final two contributions follow an entrepreneurship perspective highlighting the usefulness of mobilization theory and the business model lens to social entrepreneurship. Despite this diversity, all contributions share the fact that they challenge narrow definitions of the unit of analysis in social entrepreneurship; they illustrate the aspect of social embeddedness, and they argue for an open-but-disciplined diversity of theories in social entrepreneurship research. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Purpose The purpose of this paper is to evaluate critically the discourse that entrepreneurship and enterprise culture are inextricably inter–twinned with profit–driven capitalist endeavour by seeking to understand whether amongst some populations, the culture of entrepreneurship is more socially–oriented than profit–driven. Design/methodology/approach To do this, a secondary analysis is undertaken of the results of the UK Global Entrepreneurship Monitor in general, and UK Social Entrepreneurship Monitor more particularly. It compares the levels and ratios of commercial–to–social entrepreneurship across various population groups and areas in the UK. Findings The finding is that there are different cultures of entrepreneurship across varying population groups. Many marginalized groups are more socially–orientated than profit–driven. This is particularly the case amongst the long–term registered disabled (2.3 times more likely to engage in social rather than commercial entrepreneurship than the average UK entrepreneur), other non–White groups (2.2 times more likely) and the retired (twice as likely). Similarly, people living in rural areas display a greater propinquity to engage in social rather than commercial entrepreneurship than those living in urban areas. Research limitations/implications The findings raise questions about whether it is appropriate to parachute into some populations a culture of commercial entrepreneurship that might be “foreign” to their enterprise culture and whether a focus on social entrepreneurship in the enterprise culture agenda will promote greater inclusiveness of populations traditionally under–represented.

In the context of social entrepreneurship, earlier research indicates that women are a better fit for leading social enterprises. However, the relevance of gender in the field of social entrepreneurship is underexplored and calls for further research, framing the mainstay of this study. Through a multiple case study approach employing four firms from two emerging markets – India and Colombia – we analyze how women entrepreneurs engage in social entrepreneurship processes in uncertain Base of the Pyramid environments. We use the effectuation lens to investigate the entrepreneurial journey and decision-making logics employed at various stages of the venture development. Findings show that women social entrepreneurs are highly motivated concerning social issues. Also, women entrepreneurs show a subtle transition between the two approaches of causation and effectuation during the venture creation processes. This study highlights the specific challenges that women entrepreneurs face in the emerging market context and the inclusive strategies they employ to enhance socio-economic development. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

However, till date, no dedicated review and conceptual framework exists, synthesizing and integrating past social entrepreneurship research in the fast growing emerging economies, commonly known as BRIICS (Brazil, Russia, India, Indonesia, China, and South Africa). The purpose of this article is to bridge that gap by conducting an integrative review of 123 most relevant peer-reviewed scholarly articles, filtered out of 1779 search results in six different research databases. Country-specific conceptual perspectives have been extracted and integrated to formulate a novel social entrepreneurship framework that is inclusive of five key social entrepreneurship dimensions emerging from these economies: (a) Social Welfare, (b) Social Capital, (c) Social Entrepreneur, (d) Economic Value Creation, and (e) Collective Endurance. This exercise was an initiative to facilitate the global community of social entrepreneurship researchers and practitioners in understanding the diversity, meaning, and evolution of the social entrepreneurship phenomenon in the context of emerging economies. They can advance research in this domain with the aid of the proposed framework and the research questions proposed for future research. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Purpose - The formation of entrepreneurial ecosystems is recognized as an activity that can produce economic development and community revitalization. Social entrepreneurship is also an activity that is receiving growing attention because of its potential for addressing social and economic problems. However, while scholars have focused on how the participants in entrepreneurial ecosystems, such as investors and support organizations, influence ecosystem functioning, it is not clear what role social entrepreneurs can play in entrepreneurial ecosystems. Nor is it known how the entrepreneurial ecosystems in which social entrepreneurs are located can influence the founding and operation of their ventures. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - In this conceptual paper, theory is proposed to explain the interrelationship between entrepreneurial ecosystems and social entrepreneurship. Findings - It is theorized that entrepreneurial ecosystems will influence the operations and effectiveness of social entrepreneurs through mechanisms such as the ecosystem's diversity of resource providers, support infrastructure, entrepreneurial culture, and learning opportunities. In turn, social entrepreneurs can shape the entrepreneurial ecosystems in which they are situated by influencing the heterogeneity of ecosystem participants, garnering attention for the ecosystem, and increasing its attractiveness to stakeholders. Originality/value - Scholars examining entrepreneurial ecosystems have not studied the role of an increasingly important market actor: The social entrepreneur. At the same time, work on social entrepreneurship has not emphasized the community of social relations and cultural milieu in which social entrepreneurs found their ventures. The theory developed addresses both of these omissions and has important implications for practitioners focused on spurring entrepreneurial ecosystems and social entrepreneurship. © 2017 Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Social entrepreneurship is a relatively young topic. Nevertheless, social entrepreneurship is becoming increasingly popular among researchers because of its contribution and prominence in society. Many entrepreneurs seek to create ventures that not only yield a profit but also add value to society. This research investigates how contingent factors of social enterprises affect job creation. The study examines the following contingent factors: Training, educational attainment, experience, family history, and financial support. This study explores the influence of these factors on business size (i.e., the outcome in the research model). The study employs fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to analyze data from a survey of 51 social enterprises. The analysis yields the most relevant factors for job creation by social enterprises. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

The economic activity of social entrepreneurs is presumed altruistic, their actions intending to primarily benefit others. The theoretical and actual motivations, social networks and values of these actors are compared in this article. A series of semi-structured interviews of prominent social entrepreneurs in the west of England form the basis of analysis. Subjects were selected through a nomination-referral technique that allows targeting for interview those who are considered prominent in the sector within the chosen location. Two types of analysis are attempted: a narrative exploration of their motivations and a semantic networks analysis of their statements. There is evidence of a conceptual association between those actors’ success, entrepreneurship, motivation and social relations that indicate profitable avenues for future research. Some policy recommendations are offered in the conclusion. The multiple roles of social entrepreneurs and the multiple audiences they address indicate multidimensional agency. The development of the sector depends on comprehending conflict inherent in their multiple agendas. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

Santos posits that social entrepreneurs maximize not on value capture, but on value creation, only satisficing on value capture to fuel operations, reinvesting in growth, whatever the specific combination of institutional means is deemed appropriate. No doubt the analytical framework of value creation and value capture casts new light on the phenomenon of social entrepreneurship, but we think Santos is asking too much by advocating a shift in focus away from the organization. On the contrary, we maintain that by refocusing the theory on the organizational level and away from the system it is possible to understand that not all organizational solutions available to social entrepreneurs are able to create value and not all value capture strategies can serve a social goal. Indeed, there is only one form of organization that fulfills the criteria of maximizing on value creation, while satisficing on value capture and that is the social enterprise. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Social entrepreneurs are viewed as having the abilities to combat social and economic problems in which government, businesses, and non-profits may not be able to solve the problems alone. Consequently, with the collaboration among these sectors, more social enterprises can be established to create social values and development in a nation, specifically among the emerging economies. Therefore, it is timely to investigate what motivates undergraduates to develop social entrepreneurial intention. Drawing from the entrepreneurial models of Shapero and Sokol (1982) and Kruger and Brazeal (1994), this study aims to examine the social entrepreneurial intention among undergraduates from the perspective of an emerging economy. The proposed conceptual model differs from the existing entrepreneurial intention studies by adding the concepts of empathy and social entrepreneurship exposure as the antecedents to perceived desirability and perceived feasibility of social enterprising start-up, which in turn link to social entrepreneurial intention. Using the quota sampling technique, data were collected from 257 business and economics undergraduates from both public and private higher education institutions in Malaysia. The survey instrument was adapted from prior related studies, for instance, Davis (1983) for empathy; Shapero and Sokol (1982) for social entrepreneurship exposure; Krueger (1993) for perceived desirability and perceived feasibility; and Chen et al. (1998) for social entrepreneurial intention. Partial least squares path modelling was used to analyze the hypothesized relationships in the proposed conceptual framework. It is hoped that the findings of this study will shed light on the existing literature of social entrepreneurship, specifically the social entrepreneurial intention studies from the emerging economies perspective.},

abstract={As a reaction against neo-liberalism, Social Entrepreneurship has been promoted as the solution to welfare problems brought about by social change and persistent unemployment. The Social Entrepreneurship Movement (SEM) proposes the reconstruction of welfare by building social partnerships between the public, social and business sectors. Major aspects of this agenda include non-profit organisations undertaking entrepreneurial ventures and the pooling of government welfare funding under the control of local communities. In this paper we argue that the SEM literature is based on two false premises: the failure to understand the true causes of mass unemployment, and the assumption that the government faces financial constraints in the provision of welfare services. We also argue that implementation of the SEM proposals would erode the rights-based eligibility to universal welfare services based on the principle of social justice. We also conclude that the SEM is indistinguishable from neo-liberalism and as such does not represent a viable solution to unemployment and the welfare needs that accompany it.},

We argue that this perspective can offer valuable insights into the still under-researched interplay between rural social entrepreneurs and their institutional environment. A key insight from our analysis refers to the dialectic of horizontal and vertical networking strategies typical of rural social entrepreneurs and their business model.

Looking primarily at the applications between contracting principal-agent relationships, the purpose of this paper is to explore how agency theory emerged from a number of economic and social developments. In doing so, the authors explain how this once dominant theory comes up short regarding varying realms of entrepreneurship as well as with multiple modern business phenomena. Design/methodology/approach – The authors first present a brief overview of agency theory. Second, the authors identify major events and people and address how they impacted the development of agency theory. Third, the authors provide insights on agency theory across three contexts (strategic entrepreneurship, social entrepreneurship, and family business). Implications, limitations, and future research directions are then offered. Findings – The authors provide a deeper understanding of agency theory, thus broadening its underpinnings and enabling readers to more readily understand why agency theory is limited in its explanation of certain and modern business phenomena. The authors find that some of the seminal influences to agency theory are quite dated which has limited its explanatory power in terms of the modern day business and with more recent disciplines such as entrepreneurship. Research limitations/implications – The authors are limited by their choices of major events that influenced agency theory at the expense of not being able to include everything that may have impacted the theory over time. These limitations, however, are offset by the research implications. As the authors highlight the underpinning of agency theory, the authors subsequently provide scholars and practitioners with five primary boundary conditions, each of which are in need of attention for agency theory to maintain relevant explanatory power. Originality/value – A deeper understanding of agency theory can be gained by looking at its underpinnings. By presenting numerous principal-agent conflicts and demonstrating areas in which it has fallen short (i.e. entrepreneurship and more recent business phenomenon), we shed light on the obstacles agency theory must overcome in order to maintain its position as a prominent theory. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Scholars have characterized social entrepreneurship as an "accumulative fragmentalism," primarily characterized by the use of case studies featuring prominent and innovative profiles of social enterprises and entrepreneurs. However, today, social entrepreneurship is between cross-currents. On the one hand, it seeks, as a subfield, to solidify its theoretical and methodological underpinnings and standpoints. On the other hand, it is consistently exposed to field expansion, given that a number of its underlying frameworks, commonly shared with other fields (such as sustainability and corporate social responsibility [CSR]), are opening up to wider vistas of conceptualization and theorization. This is often through the influence of practice as well as theory. The contribution of the paper is threefold. First, it enhances our understanding of social entrepreneurship field development by identifying cross-currents and by highlighting new angles for paradigmatic and theoretical positioning. Second, it implements a framework that scholars previously employed within the original field of entrepreneurship (Bourdieu's theory of capitals and their transformations); in doing so, it also proceeds to propose an enrichment to the framework by including additional capitals that are specifically relevant for the field of social entrepreneurship and that are influenced by common agendas, as those exist in the fields of sustainability and CSR. Third, it offers insights for theory, as well as practice, which relate to understandings from the first two contributions. © 2014 International Council for Small Business.},

Although the general context of this study was that of small rural towns in Australia's outback that are experiencing decline, each of the four towns studied had unique features which could influence the mobilization of social capital. Rural communities have the willingness and capacity to mobilize but whether this capacity is actualized may well depend on the presence of other mobilizing factors. Specifically the intervention study found that a structure needs to be in place which can take the initiative and work across the community - engaging a range of organizations. Second, the structure needs to be supported, but not controlled, by local government. Third, it needs the kind of social entrepreneurship that can sustain a community-wide vision and bring together the diverse groups within the community. Résumé: Les recherches présentées s'appuient sur une opération destinée à mobiliser le capital social, afin d'étudier les dynamiques selon lesquelles il a influé sur le développement communautaire. L'aptitude du capital social à faciliter le développement dépend du contexte dans lequel celui-ci se produit. Bien que cette étude se place dans de petites villes de campagnes reculées d'Australie confrontées à un déclin, chacune des quatre villes concernées présentaient des spécificités propres susceptibles d'influencer la mobilisation du capital social. Les communautés rurales ont la volonté et la capacité de se mobiliser, mais la concrétisation de cette capacité peut dépendre largement de la présence d'autres facteurs mobilisateurs. En particulier, l'analyse de l'opération montre qu'il doit exister une structure capable de prendre l'initiative et de travailler avec toute la communauté en impliquant tout un éventail d'organismes. Ensuite, il faut que la structure soit épaulée, et non contrôlée, par le gouvernement local. Enfin, elle a besoin d'une sorte d'esprit d'entreprise sociale qui puisse nourrir une vision à l'échelle communautaire et réunir les différents groupes présents dans la communauté. © 2010 The Authors.

abstract={Technological innovation is the new backbone for companies. Exploiting and exploring new knowledge increase the chance of survival in the current dynamic market. Alongside, there are countries were be an innovative need to face up social and political challenges. This has transformed their economy, spreading an entrepreneurial mindset mingled with the willing to help a local community. This phenomenon is called social entrepreneurship which is leveraging new economies and building wealth, environmental system. In this vein, the present research seeks to offer qualitative research on 142 social entrepreneurs in an emerging country. The scope is to analyse if social entrepreneurship, entrepreneurial characteristics, and entrepreneurial ecosystem influence innovation. As emerged, technological innovation is affected by the first two factors but the entrepreneurial ecosystem is still not supportive. New, several activities should be organised by the government to assist entrepreneurs, whereas, the entrepreneurs are socially motivated to build up his enterprise. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={In the collective imagination, the practices and outcomes of social entrepreneurship seem to hold hope for a better future. So far, these practices have been largely assumed as idealised types with the ‘social’ in social entrepreneurship underexplored. Such assumed neutrality, we argue, is hampering the development of a more robust theoretical corpus for understanding the phenomenon and inspiring practices that are more effective. In this article, we analyse the sensemaking of the social in social entrepreneurship by exploring the ways in which social entrepreneurs make sense of social problems and develop solutions for addressing them. Our empirical analyses of the stories of 15 social entrepreneurs indicate two distinct types of sensemaking and sensegiving practices, aligned with Amartya Sen’s notions of social justice. Drawing on these findings, sensemaking and social justice theory, we elaborate a two-type social sensemaking model pertaining to the appreciation and assessment of circumstances and the differing problem/solution combinations emerging from alternative ontological views of what constitutes a social problem. © The Author(s) 2018.},

abstract={This article explores the effects of embeddedness in communities upon entrepreneurial practices. Based on the lived experiences of 10 craft entrepreneurs, this study reveals that within certain contexts, such as craft communities, entrepreneurs are expected to exhibit high levels of camaraderie and generosity, which leads them to create social value by supporting their peers and freely sharing their resources. Entrepreneurs achieve ‘fitting in’ not only by learning accepted norms, but also by performing strategic actions which allow them to temporarily adapt their conduct to meet the expectations of community members. Thus, this study exposes a largely concealed element of social entrepreneurial practice. This article also reveals that embeddedness in communities can lead entrepreneurs to collaborate with potential competitors. Craft entrepreneurs share their economic, cultural, social and symbolic capital in order to support and help revitalise their communities, to perpetuate their respective industries and to sustain a genuine interest in hand-crafted products. They consider such supportive behaviour a social responsibility that is shared among community members and a task that is passed from one generation to the next. Thus, this article reveals that collaboration and social value creation can be embraced in response to community norms and expectations. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Due to the nature of lending practices and support services offered to the poor in developing countries, portfolio risk is a growing concern for the microfinance industry. Though previous research highlights the importance of risk for microfinance organizations, not much is known about how microfinance organizations can mitigate risks incurred from providing loans to the poor in developing countries. Further, though many microfinance organizations practice corporate social responsibility (CSR) to help create economic and social wealth in developing countries, the impact of such CSR practices remains an underdeveloped area of inquiry. We use a normative ethics lens to develop an ethics-based CSR theory that differentiates between three forms of ethics-based CSR—virtue, consequentialist, and deontological. We argue that while all three forms can help mitigate risk, virtue ethics-based CSR is potentially the most useful form of CSR toward mitigating microfinance portfolio risk. We test our hypotheses using a sample of microfinance organizations from across the world. Our findings suggest that virtue ethics-based CSR is not just an important philosophical paradigm; it can actually help mitigate microfinance portfolio risk when implemented in practice. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={One of the main challenges in social entrepreneurship is capturing stakeholder support-from consumers, to legislators, to volunteers, to many others. Identifying likely supporters is the first step to sustainable success, but a difficult one. This research examines whether personality influences a person's tendency to support innovative social entrepreneurial (SE) ventures. Here, the possible influence of the "Big Five" personality traits (i.e., openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism [OCEAN]) is examined; however, in line with prior research, attention is focused on both openness (an OCEAN trait) and empathy (a non-OCEAN trait). Two types of SE ventures are considered: social innovations and technological innovations. Data from a survey evaluating six SE ventures (three social and three technological) reveal that participants' personality influences support; however, observed influence differs by type of venture-openness underlies support of technological innovations, and empathy underlies support of social innovations. Further process analysis demonstrates that this influence is not direct but rather is mediated by people's perceptions of how much change the venture will make. These results offer social entrepreneurs insights into who might be prone to support SE ventures and, more important, why. © 2012, American Marketing Association.},

abstract={Building on the ‘entrepreneuring as emancipation’ perspective, I explore the emancipatory potential of social entrepreneurship as a means to disengage individuals enthralled to ideology and trapped by their own past behavior. I studied two former religious-based terrorists from Indonesia, and their social enterprise, a cafe chain, which has successfully emancipated 10 ex-terrorists. In this paper, I show how engagement in entrepreneurship can be emancipatory through allowing individuals not only to escape some ideological constraints but also to construct new meaning in life and new social roles and connections that provide a platform for building a new future. Importantly, because social entrepreneurship as a form of organizing permits autonomy from an exclusive focus on profitability, it afforded the entrepreneurs I studied to achieve a degree of emancipation both for themselves and also for those they served. My results also have substantial practical value in elucidating a potentially valuable tool in efforts to reduce terrorist violence. I develop a grounded process model of social entrepreneurship as emancipatory work to summarize the study and offer avenues for future research. © 2017 The Author},

abstract={Over the last decade, explicit emphasis on the creation of social value has grown in profit-seeking firms as well as nonprofits and has even led to the emergence of a new legal organizational classification known as for-benefit corporations. Like financial value, social value is dynamic and therefore subject to perpetual changes in the firm's external environment, changes that yield opportunities and threats for the firm. Although social entrepreneurship researchers have begun to study the identification and exploitation of opportunities to create social value, this research has taken place primarily within the context of startup organizations. In contrast, corporate entrepreneurship research has emphasized value creation within existing firms, but focused primarily on the identification and exploitation of opportunities to create financial value. Combining the two, we examine the creation of social value within the firm by proposing the social corporate entrepreneurship scale (SCES), a new instrument that measures organizational antecedents for social corporate entrepreneurship and offers managers an opportunity to analyze whether the perceived environment is supportive of corporate entrepreneurial behaviors intended to create social as well as financial value. The article concludes with a discussion of the instrument's potential contribution to managerial practice. © 2016 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University},

Results reveal nine critical problem areas we have arranged along three dimensions: financial returns, social returns, and relationships and infrastructure. They comprise investors’ and social entrepreneurs’ practices, institutional settings which are still heavily influenced by peculiarities of the German welfare systems, as well as undeveloped framework conditions in the social investment market.

abstract={While the past decade has produced a number of insights into the process of institutional change, scholars still lack a comprehensive understanding of the germinal stages of institutional entrepreneurship. More specifically, further knowledge is needed into what factors cause certain individuals to initiate norm-breaking behaviour while others continue to adhere to societal expectations. Prior work seeking to inform this question has focused either on individual-level or environmental-level explanations. Comparatively, we employ a social network perspective as a ‘meso-level’ lens into the space where actors and their environment intersect. Based upon our qualitative findings, we propose that social ties can serve as an important factor in enabling (heterophilic ties) as well as constraining (homophilic ties) institutional change. However, our data also suggest that these network forces are highly dynamic and contingent upon tie frequency, the sequencing of tie contact, and the prevailing social norms in which tie contact takes place. © The Author(s) 2016.},

These new policy networks, through an array of new modalities of governance and political and discursive strategies, have come to exert an impressive level of influence on public policy in the last 30 years in the United States. We describe and analyze several model education bills that ALEC has promoted and describe the political and discursive strategies ALEC employs. We found that these strategies, which are employed by corporate leaders and largely Republican legislators, are aimed at a strategic alliance of neoliberal, neoconservative, libertarian, and liberal constituencies with the goal of privatizing and marketizing public education. © 2014, The Author(s) 2014.},

abstract={This paper seeks to contribute to a conceptual perspective with which to approach the evaluations and explanation of social entrepreneurs as agents of social change. First, it discusses the capability approach as a comprehensive normative framework with which to articulate 'the social' in a way that deals with the triple challenge of specifying 'the social' in a context of conflicts of interests, value diversity and exclusive public spheres. Second, the paper proposes two explanatory hypotheses of innovation for social change: (a) social innovation as the carrying out of new combinations of capabilities; (b) social entrepreneurs as characterized by their capacity to imagine and carry out new combinations of capabilities. The combination of capabilities suggests a subset of human development where ethics meets innovation: a capability innovation pathway at the crossroads of long-term, societal perspectives on change (human development, Schumpeterian economic development) where innovation is social and capability advancement entrepreneurial. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={This paper adopts a process perspective on sport entrepreneurship in the fitness industry, utilizing phenomenological inquiry into the entrepreneurial lives of eleven fitness entrepreneurs. The purpose of this paper is to reveal how fitness entrepreneurs strategize and pursue competitive advantage in a non-traditional industry. Our findings show that while fitness entrepreneurs share many similarities with non-sport entrepreneurs, fitness entrepreneurs are affected by a variety of factors attributable to working in a non-conventional industry. The present study contributes to the emerging theoretical discussions surrounding the concept of sport entrepreneurship and highlights the value of process perspectives when examining entrepreneurial activities. No empirical studies thus far exist that seek to illuminate the exact nature of individual sport entrepreneurship. This study is a first step in developing testable hypotheses and to contrast sport entrepreneurship to non-sport entrepreneurship. Additionally, our research provides fitness entrepreneurs in the industry with information on what they may face when pursuing their own business objectives. Finally, sport management and entrepreneurship curricula can be enhanced based on information gathered in this study. © 2016},

abstract={Purpose: Coronavirus (Covid-19) is a pandemic that not only has caused significant havoc around the world but also presents some important opportunities for entrepreneurs to be innovative in the marketplace. The purpose of this paper is to detail in more depth how entrepreneurs have been affected by the crisis by focussing on specific types of entrepreneurship in terms of cultural, lifestyle and social change. Design/methodology/approach: A review of the existing literature on Covid-19 and crisis management is conducted that highlights the effect of the pandemic on entrepreneurs. This approach enables an integration of the existing research on resilience in terms of how entrepreneurs adapt and pivot their business models in response to change. Thereby enabling a contemporary view about the ways entrepreneurs can contribute to societal well-being in times of huge economic and social upheaval. Findings: While entrepreneurs by nature are resilient, the Covid-19 crisis in terms of its magnitude and length has led to specific challenges faced by entrepreneurs in adapting to the new environment. These challenges can be related to the way entrepreneurs respond to uncertainty by being flexible but also through the support of an entrepreneurial ecosystem environment. Originality/value: Due to the Covid-19 crisis being an ongoing and recent phenomenon, this paper is amongst the first to focus specifically on how cultural, lifestyle and social attributes of society have changed. Thereby providing advice to current and future entrepreneurs about how to respond to crisis situations and to manage short- and long-term considerations. There is a growing body of research in entrepreneurship that is offering valuable insights by taking a crisis approach. In addition to the practical opportunities touched upon in this paper, there are associated numerous research potentials due to the intersection of crisis management, entrepreneurship and resilience literature. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

In contrast, whilst we found evidence that entrepreneurial leadership was positively related to followers’ innovative behavior, the relationship between servant leadership and employees’ innovative behavior was insignificant. Our research contributes to the underdeveloped literature on leadership in social enterprises by exploring the relative effectiveness of different leadership styles (namely an entrepreneurial leadership style and a servant leadership style) in promoting follower work attitudes and behaviors in social enterprises. In addition, our research demonstrates the importance of leadership over and above followers’ individual differences such as pro-social motivation and creative self-efficacy. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

We label these social goals and intentions as social salience and draw on goal theory and existing understandings on intentions to explain how the presence of a social salience in an organization is related to the social performance of their organization. Utilizing structural equation modeling, we show that gender positively influences social salience that subsequently has a positive relationship with the social performance of the organization. We also show that social salience fully mediates the relationship between gender and social performance implying that gender alone is not enough to explain the social performance of an organization. We conclude by highlighting the implications, contributions, and future research that result from our findings. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Purpose – The purpose of this paper includes two interconnected objectives. The first is to provide a reconceptualisation of social value creation as social constraint alleviation. The second is to respond to the call put forward by Giuliani and Macchi (2014) to produce synergies between bodies of literature exploring the development impact of businesses. The paper focuses on ideas from the global value chain/global production networks (GVC/GPN), business and human rights, corporate social responsibility (CSR), international business (IB) and (social) entrepreneurship literatures. Design/methodology/approach – The paper offers a reconceptualisation of social value creation by building on the synergies, complementarities and limitations of existing concepts identified through the literature review. Findings – The reconceptualisation of social value creation put forward in this paper contributes to the literature in the following way. It offers a useful and clear definition of the term “social” (Devinney, 2009), and it attends to the limitations of the constraint concept as put forward by Ted London and his collaborators (London, 2011). Furthermore, it sketches out the basic ideas of a two-system approach to allow for the differentiation between symptom treatment and root cause alleviation. Finally, it offers a refinement of Wettstein’s (2012) proposed capability-based remedial action concept. The paper furthermore proposes that there are three distinct ways in which businesses generally respond to social constraints. Originality/value – The paper illustrates how the redefined concept of social value creation can connect different bodies of literature and help make sense of existing empirical results, without engaging in definitional debates. © Sinkovics, Sinkovics, Hoque and Czaban.},

abstract={This paper evaluates critically the ideologically driven representation of the entrepreneur as a heroic figurehead of capitalism pursuing for-profit entrepreneurship in the formal commercial economy. To do this, two separate streams of literature are brought together, which highlight how many entrepreneurs operate in the informal economy and how many others are social entrepreneurs. Reporting a 2006 survey of the lived practices of entrepreneurship involving interviews with 120 entrepreneurs in a rural West of England locality in the UK, formal sector for-profit entrepreneurship is shown to be a minority practice. Most entrepreneurs are revealed to operate wholly or partially in the informal economy and to varying extents adopt social goals, including those engaged in a newly identified form of entrepreneurship so far missed by the entrepreneurship literature, namely social entrepreneurship in the informal economy. This reveals the need to de-link entrepreneurship from the formal commercial economy. The resultant outcome is to replace the dominant representation of the entrepreneur as a heroic figurehead of capitalism with a re-representation of the entrepreneur that recognizes the multifarious lived practices of entrepreneurship and therefore demonstrates the feasibility of imagining and enacting alternative futures beyond capitalist hegemony. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

The purpose of this paper is to discuss different approaches taken by two UK signatories to the UN Principles for Responsible Management Education (PRME). Design/methodology/approach: The two approaches examined are: MSc Entrepreneurship students opting for placements with social enterprises; and MBA students undertaking workshops using "live" case studies. A content analysis of the experiences of students from their written reflective narratives is presented. This is supplemented by reflections of the facilitators and tutors. Findings: The analysis reveals that the opportunity to work with social entrepreneurs and/or "responsible" business professionals provides the business students with inspirational role models and positive social learning opportunities. Research limitations/implications: This paper suggests that experiential learning is an effective way of integrating ethics, responsibility and sustainability into the curriculum but the research draws on the experience of two schools. Further research is important to explore these findings in other contexts. Practical implications: The authors argue that direct exposure to a business culture (and/or behaviour) that is predicated upon ethical/social responsibility and sustainability is an effective means to embed these values in the curriculum.

We suggest that the image and textual practices of storytelling have changed as both entrepreneurs court philanthropic and social entrepreneur identity markers. Our contribution to entrepreneurial identity is to apply double and multiple narrations, the appropriation of another's narrative words (or images) into another's narrative, and relate such storytelling moves to visuality. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Entrepreneurship research on prosocial motivation has outlined its positive impact on well-being, but still little is known about its power, which may have deleterious personal consequences under certain conditions. In this study, we ask whether prosocial motivation can harm entrepreneurs’ subjective well-being when they run a commercial venture. Embedded within a contingency perspective informed by self-determination theory, we build on longitudinal survey data to explain the effect of prosocial motivation on entrepreneurs’ overall life satisfaction. Our analysis demonstrates that prosocial motivation has a negative effect on entrepreneurs’ life satisfaction due to increased levels of stress. However, our findings show that the negative effect of prosocial motivation dissipates when perceived autonomy at work is high compared to when it is low. Overall, our research raises questions on the role of prosocial motivation for entrepreneurs’ subjective well-being and, in particular, discusses its potential “dark side” in the context of commercial entrepreneurship. Executive summary: Can there be a “dark side” in helping others? If so, how can we better understand under what conditions it emerges? Entrepreneurship research conventionally presents prosocial motivation as a positive driver for social venture creation and entrepreneurs’ well-being. However, we have little knowledge about the consequences of prosocial motivation when we move outside the social entrepreneurship context. When prosocially motivated entrepreneurs lead a commercial venture, they face the difficult task of balancing the desire to help others with the financial requirements of the business. The challenge of simultaneously accomplishing commercial and prosocial goals can result in a stressful experience that is detrimental to the entrepreneur's well-being. In this study, we ask whether and under what circumstances prosocial motivation can harm entrepreneurs’ well-being. Embedded in a contingency perspective informed by self-determination theory, this article expands our knowledge on the effects of prosocial motivation in the context of commercial entrepreneurship. We draw from original longitudinal survey data on 186 entrepreneurs in the United Kingdom to demonstrate that prosocial motivation causes entrepreneurs stress and through that stress has a negative effect on their life satisfaction. We also show that the negative effect of prosocial motivation diminishes when the degree of autonomy entrepreneurs perceive in the pursuit of daily work tasks is high. To explore the uniqueness of the entrepreneurial context, we run a comparative analysis with a sample of 544 employees. This analysis confirms that stress fully mediates the negative relationship between prosocial motivation and subjective well-being, but for employees, this negative effect disappears when their level of intrinsic motivation—the desire to expend effort based on enjoyment of the work itself—is high. Building on our findings, we generate several important contributions. First, we help develop an understanding of the “dark side” of prosocial motivation by demonstrating that under certain circumstances, the desire to help others can be detrimental to entrepreneurs’ subjective well-being. Second, we expand knowledge about the link between prosocial motivation and well-being by considering the boundary conditions (perceived autonomy and intrinsic motivation) that influence the dynamics of their relationship. Third, we set the stage for further investigations that aim to clarify the relationship between motivation and perceived autonomy and its effect on personal outcomes across different work domains. The key insight of the study is that prosocial motivation creates a dilemma for entrepreneurs when operating a commercial business such that the desire to help others outside the context of immediate work tasks can harm their personal well-being. We also find that the perception of autonomy is key for commercial entrepreneurs to be able to realize their prosocial motivation without creating stressful situations. Extending our understanding of the conditions that shape the relationship between prosocial motivation and well-being among entrepreneurs would help in developing a more holistic notion of prosocial business venturing, one that includes the role of both commercial and social enterprising activities in contributing to personal and societal well-being. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={Purpose: The paper aims to investigate how the social entrepreneurial intention antecedents directly and indirectly affect social entrepreneurial intent. The participants of the study were Filipino and Indonesian university students from selected higher education institutions (HEIs). Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative research design was used and partial least square-structural equation modeling was used to measure the direct and indirect effects of the structural model. Findings: The results revealed that prior experience with social problems positively and significantly affects empathy, moral obligation, social entrepreneurial self-efficacy and perceived social support. Moreover, it was also found that social entrepreneurial self-efficacy and perceived social support positively and significantly affect social entrepreneurial intent, and these two antecedents mediate the positive relationship between prior experience with social problems and social entrepreneurial intent. Research limitations/implications: As the present study only examined social entrepreneurial intentions among Filipino and Indonesian university students, other researchers may test the framework in another locale. Others may find interest in identifying the significant difference in social entrepreneurial intent among between or among nations. Practical implications: The findings of the present study can benefit HEIs in terms of offering social entrepreneurship programs and courses. The role of HEIs is truly important. Providing an avenue for students for them to be socially entrepreneurial and empowering them to be future social entrepreneurs can truly help in sustainably promoting social entrepreneurship. These can be done by designing relevant learning materials and requirements that will permit students to be social venture creators. Social implications: Based on this study, if these students were exposed to social entrepreneurship activities during their university life (prior experience), then the propensity for them to be social venture creators in high. With the myriad problems in the Philippines and Indonesia, exposure to social problems is evident. Through proper inculcation of social entrepreneurial spirit, Filipino and Indonesian students will greatly create massive impact in the landscape of Asian social entrepreneurship. Originality/value: The present study offers a new perspective on social entrepreneurial intentions, as it is in Asian setting. It also provides a viewpoint where only social entrepreneurial self-efficacy and perceived social support positively affect social entrepreneurial intent and, at the same time, act as mediators between prior experience with social problem and social entrepreneurial intent. With these results, it enriches the theoretical foundations of social entrepreneurship. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Attention toward social entrepreneurship has increased worldwide, particularly within younger generations. Based on the identified model of social entrepreneurial intentions, this study proposed a multiple mediation framework to examine the mediating role of entrepreneurial creativity for university students. It also compared the differences between Taiwanese (N = 311) and Hong Kong students (N = 311). Through a survey using both online and offline channels, the results of Study 1 confirmed the factor structures of the 3 scales, involving 5 antecedents of social entrepreneurial intention (i.e., empathy, moral obligation, self-efficacy, perceived social support, and prior experience with social problems), 2 factors of entrepreneurial creativity (i.e., originality and usefulness), and 2 factors of social entrepreneurial intention (i.e. conviction and preparation). The results of Study 2 supported the proposed multiple mediation model across regions. Prior experience with social problems, perceived social support, and originality were identified as the 3 most influential factors affecting the social entrepreneurial intentions of university students. The major differences between Taiwan and Hong Kong involved prior experience, empathy, self-efficacy, perceived social support, and usefulness. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Using 107,738 individual-level responses from 27 countries for the year 2009 obtained from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) survey, and supplementing with country-level data obtained from Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effectiveness (GLOBE) and Sustainability Society Foundation (SSF), our findings from multilevel analysis show that transformational CLTs and sustainability conditions of society positively influence the likelihood of individuals becoming social entrepreneurs. Further, the effectiveness of transformational CLTs matters more for social entrepreneurship when the sustainability of society is low, which suggests the interaction between cultural leadership styles and societal sustainability. This article contributes to comparative entrepreneurship research by introducing strong cultural antecedents of social entrepreneurship in transformational CLTs and societal sustainability. We discuss various implications and limitations of our study, and we suggest directions for future research. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={Sustainable entrepreneurship is seen as a promising approach aiming to solve complex social, environmental, and economic problems with innovative solutions. Whilst the concept of collaboration provides an important conceptual overlap between the entrepreneurship and sustainability literatures, it has so far received little attention in sustainable entrepreneurship research. The purpose of this article is to explore links between collaborative entrepreneurship and sustainable development. Sustainability challenges increase the importance for entrepreneurial collaboration in three ways: first, for cross-actor participation within entrepreneurial processes; second, for coordinating across sustainability issues and between entrepreneurial solutions; and third, for cross-sector cooperation between different forms of entrepreneurship such as social entrepreneurship, sustainable entrepreneurship, and policy entrepreneurship. We show how understanding this link between collaborative entrepreneurship and sustainable development sheds new light on both entrepreneurship theory and practice as well as sustainability research.

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to identify the role of cognitive styles (CgStys) and self-efficacy (SEff) in the formation of social entrepreneurial intentions (SEIs) among the students of a premier multi-campus technical university in India using the theory of planned behaviour as the research framework. Design/methodology/approach: A 54-item questionnaire was responded by 550 students. The data were collected by employing a systematic random sampling method. In the total sample of the respondents, 67 per cent (n=368) were male and 33 per cent (n=182) were female and the average age of the respondents was 20 years. Structural equation modelling has been used for data analysis. Findings: The results of the study support that the relationship between antecedents (CgStys and SEff) and SEIs was mediated by the attitude towards becoming a social entrepreneur, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control. Findings of this research study also suggest that students with high level of SEff are more inclined towards social entrepreneurial activities. Research limitations/implications: The study was confined to the students from a technical university, and it may not give the generalized findings for students from the non-technical stream. Practical implications: The finding of this research study will facilitate policy makers and educators for promoting social entrepreneurial activities at the university level. Based on the results and findings of the study, the educators may improve upon the support system to help and motivate students to opt social entrepreneurship as their career choice. Originality/value: This is one of its kinds of research conducted in the Indian context. Findings of this research will be helpful in predicting how the intention process of Indian students is affected by their CgStys and SEff. © 2017, 2017, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Most of the world's poor live in developing markets and face unmet needs in core areas such as education, health, energy, sanitation and financial services. This offers businesses a vast opportunity for growth as these economies emerge from low-income to middle-income status. Social businesses in particular address a social need while generating profits typically reinvested into the business itself, but there is limited understanding of the ways through which social businesses achieve scale. This paper investigates how social businesses can scale up. First, we define scaling up as “increasing the number of customers or members of a business as well as expanding its offer and maximising its revenues until it reaches millions of people.” Second, using three in-depth case studies of social businesses that successfully scaled up according to these definitions, BRAC, Aravind and Amul, we identify scaling up strategies for social businesses. We identified market penetration, market development, product development and diversification as key strategies at different stages of business maturity. We find that there are two ways of increasing income generated that are linked to these four strategies: increasing revenue per stream and diversifying revenue streams. Our findings give insight to companies aiming to pursue social businesses and adds to the sparse literature on scaling up social businesses. A fruitful future research avenue would be to investigate the best sequence for applying these scaling strategies across companies and sectors over time. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine the social entrepreneurship focussed organizations in the context of challenges faced and strategic actions adopted by them during the different stages of self-sustainable business model design and implementation. Design/methodology/approach – The empirical context involves the use of qualitative multi-case-based research methodology for data collection and analysis. The sampling involves undertaking the field study of social entrepreneurship oriented organizations, which have made the perceptible socio-economic difference in the lives of the rural and semi-urban population lying at the base of the pyramid (BoP) in India. Findings – The findings of this study are presented in two complementary stages. The first stage involves presenting the narrative incorporating the emergent themes and key characteristics of the social entrepreneurship focussed organizations based on the field-research based data collection and analysis. The second stage involves mapping the challenges with the strategic actions thereby formulating a challenge-action framework. Research limitations/implications – The paper strengthens the belief in social entrepreneurship as a viable alternative for creating a market-based ecosystem at the BoP. This paper highlights the conception of social entrepreneurship in terms of challenges and corresponding strategic actions. Practical implications – The derived challenge-action framework will enable the social entrepreneurs to learn, understand, design and implement a better informed and transparent market-based business models at the BoP resulting in reduced market risks and uncertainty. Social implications – The government needs to recognize the social entrepreneurs as partners having a separate legal entity as well as consider their inputs and on-field experiences while framing the policies in favor of the BoP. In addition, the government needs to facilitate the social entrepreneurs in leveraging the government network and institutions for reaching the BoP segment. Originality/value – This study is an original contribution to the field of social entrepreneurship in number of ways. The first contribution lies in reviewing the research literature from the definition perspective. The second contribution lies in reviewing the research literature to determine the key challenges faced by the social entrepreneurs at the BoP. The third contribution lies in identifying the propositions and conceptualizing the challenge-action framework depicting the challenges faced and strategic actions required by the social entrepreneurs for successful and sustainable social intervention at the BoP. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={While research has focused on why certain entrepreneurs elect to create innovative solutions to social problems, very little is known about why some social entrepreneurs choose to scale their solutions while others do not. Research on scaling has generally focused on organizational characteristics often overlooking factors at the individual level that may affect scaling decisions. Drawing on the multidimensional construct of moral intensity, we propose a theoretical model of ethical decision making to explain why a social entrepreneur’s perception of moral intensity of the social problem, coupled with their personal desire for control, can significantly influence scaling decisions. Specifically, we propose that higher levels of perceived moral intensity will positively influence the likelihood of scaling through open as opposed to closed modes in order to achieve greater speed and scope of social impact. However, we also propose this effect will be negatively moderated by a social entrepreneur’s higher levels of desire for control. Our model has implications for research and practice at the interface of ethics and social entrepreneurship. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

This is compared with the case study approach that is traditionally used within the classroom environment. Our study found that both approaches can be successful in raising awareness and improving the attitudes of participating students, increasing the probability that they will support socially oriented initiatives immediately or in the future. Interestingly, many students who participated in SBP teaching develop a local awareness of social and civic matters, while many of those who participated in case study learning develop a wider national and international perspective. In addition, it is found that many of those who participated in SBP development develop a deeper managerial and technical understanding of managing organizations within the social economy. © Academy of Management Learning & Education.},

abstract={Purpose – This paper aims to contribute to a better understanding of the phenomenon of social entrepreneurship, paying special attention to the new narratives that are emerging about this phenomenon in the context of Africa. Design/methodology/approach – The paper addresses this issue, by comparing the meanings of what is called “social” in this context and in developed areas. The paper’s particular interest in the use of language and narratives is grounded in the experience of how narratives and stories are genuinely constitutive and perfomative of people’s actions. Findings – This paper reveals that “social” in the social entrepreneurship narratives does not necessarily have the same meaning in different contexts. Specifically, when the phenomenon is re-interpreted in the context of the discourses that come from a developing area such as South Africa, it adds flexibility and a more local sense to the entrepreneurs’ social missions. Research limitations/implications – The study was affected by the limited availability of published data on social entrepreneurship in Africa. Economic challenges and failures by governments to access donor funds have resulted in militant governance thereby reducing the role of social entrepreneurship to negligible levels. Originality/value – The study provides a narrative lens of looking at the challenges that social entrepreneurship is facing in Africa. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={This study investigates the cultural drivers of social entrepreneurship (SE), focusing on the way in which Global Leadership and Organizational Behaviour Effectiveness (GLOBE) affects social entrepreneurial activity (SEA) in different countries. The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) and GLOBE project were used as data sources. Cultural values, regional affiliation, and economic development levels were used to cluster the selected countries. Correlations between values and operating SEA were checked for the entire sample, as well as for each of the three clusters. A positive correlation between ‘Gender Egalitarianism’ and narrowly defined operating SEA and negative correlation between ‘Uncertainty Avoidance’ and the aforementioned SEA was confirmed for all the countries, while the linkage between ‘Future Orientation’, ‘In-group Collectivism’, and operating SEA was partially verified. Research results suggest that culture is not sufficient to justify national differences in SE rates. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Social entrepreneurship increasingly involves collective, voluntary organizing efforts where success depends on generating and sustaining members’ participation. To investigate how such participatory social ventures achieve member engagement in pluralistic institutional settings, we conducted a qualitative, inductive study of German Renewable Energy Source Cooperatives (RESCoops). Our findings show how value tensions emerge from differences in RESCoop members’ relative prioritization of community, environmental, and commercial logics, and how cooperative leaders manage these tensions and sustain member participation through temporal, structural, and collaborative compromise strategies. We unpack the mechanisms by which each strategy enables members to justify organizational decisions that violate their personal value priorities and demonstrate their varying implications for organizational growth. Our findings contribute new insights into the challenges of collective social entrepreneurship, the capacity of hybrid organizing strategies to mitigate value concessions, and the importance of logic combinability as a key dimension of pluralistic institutional settings. © 2018, The Author(s).},

abstract={Social entrepreneurship is aimed at the practical implementation of innovative solutions to the most painful problems of society: poverty, hunger, unemployment, illiteracy, diseases. In the conditions of lack of resources, social entrepreneurs are forced to creatively approach their attraction and how to use them, thus generating social and environmental innovations. The purpose of the article is to study the concept and perspectives of the development of social entrepreneurship within the framework of modern economic realities of the development of society, and also to reveal the legal status of activities in the field of social entrepreneurship in accordance with modern legislation. The methodological basis of this study includes the dialectical method of knowledge, based on a system of general scientific and private-scientific methods: a logical method (in the formulation of the material, the formulation of conclusions); historical method (in the process of studying the evolution of ideas about entrepreneurship); and statistical method (in the process of analysis and synthesis of the material); content analysis (analysis of individual provisions of legislative acts, scientific works), the method of system analysis and others. The practical significance lies in the fact that in many countries of the world there is a great interest in social entrepreneurship on the part of legislators and governments. This is due to the reduction of budget financing of the social sphere in developed countries and the desire of the authorities to attract private capital to the sphere of social transformations. The study of the problems of the development of social entrepreneurship is now being actively discussed in the state and scientific community. © 2018, Allied Business Academies.

We employ a partially grounded theory approach to examine the profiles of Ashoka fellows and find that despite the vast differences in their local environments, successful social entrepreneurs engage in similar bricolage processes in three domains of value creation: they tend to refuse limitations imposed by the environment, utilize resources in new and innovative ways, and engage a wide range of stakeholders as partners. Additionally, successful social entrepreneurs avoid just “making do”; instead, they rely on ingenieur-type of approach in their operational process to create and establish replicable systems to fulfil their social vision. We discuss the remarkable consistency in the approaches utilized by successful social entrepreneurs across the three countries from the perspective of theory and practice. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

A cohort of students who had undergone social entrepreneurship training under the auspices of Enactus South Africa was studied to determine the relationship between these three key variables associated with entrepreneurship tendencies. The study, in particular, addresses the question of whether practical entrepreneurship training bears any consequences on developing students' personal attitudes, entrepreneurship knowledge, and entrepreneurship intentions. Stratified sampling techniques were utilized to collect data from 355 Enactus South Africa students from the constituent 27 colleges and universities that make up Enactus South Africa. While findings of the study indicated that both entrepreneurial knowledge and personal attitudes have significant influence on entrepreneurship intentions, personal attitudes were observed as having a greater influence on the former. Furthermore, high levels of entrepreneurship knowledge were observed to impact on favorable attitudes towards entrepreneurship. © Ndivhuho Tshikovhi, Richard Shambare, 2015.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the possible benefits of a work-based learning (WBL) model in "social entrepreneurship" for enhancing graduate employability and an appreciation for "responsible" entrepreneurship. Design/methodology/approach: Pre- and post-course experience surveys were conducted with the yearly cohorts, followed by focus group discussions with students in each semester between 2008 and 2011. In addition, ten not-for-profit (NFP) industry partners were interviewed for their feedback on the enhanced curriculum. Findings: The findings strongly validate the adoption of WBL curriculum for social entrepreneurship in enhancing graduate employability and opportunities for responsible entrepreneurship education. The case study also provides insights into how to overcome the key challenges relating to designing and implementing WBL models through a curriculum innovation in social entrepreneurship. Research limitations/implications: Further research with longitudinal data is needed to validate the link between students undertaking work-based learning and enhanced graduate employability. Future research should also investigate whether there is a major difference in the associated benefits and challenges of WBL initiatives between "social" and "for-profit" enterprises. Practical implications: Higher education providers could consider incorporating WBL as part of their response to the employability agenda, in a climate where employers are increasingly seeking graduates who possess entrepreneurial skills and an awareness of ethical and environmental concerns emerging from the new post-global recession economic era. Originality/value: Social entrepreneurship has received scant attention within the field of WBL. This case study demonstrates how this field can inform the WBL model to enhance graduate employability. It also provides a case for how WBL within the NFP sector can produce more socially responsible graduates who are capable of adding value to the CSR initiatives of organisations across sectors. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Examples from seed plant initiatives and reducing homelessness in times of crisis are discussed as a way to explain social value co-creation. Moreover, the different ways countries have responded to the covid-19 crisis are stated as a way to understand contextual differences in global society. Originality/value: This article is amongst the first to focus on the link between covid-19 and social entrepreneurship from a value co-creation perspective thereby enabling a new way of thinking about the crisis from a social policy perspective.

abstract={Social innovation (SI) is a complex construct that is lacking a unifying paradigm in social sciences. However, together with the recent attention towards social change, it requires a theoretical perspective that analyzes the construct within its institutional context (IC) without forgetting that the term is socially constructed. This current study aims to contribute to the literature by exploring and describing the inter-linkages between institutional voids (IVs)/institutional supports (ISs) perspectives and SI process by positioning the actor as the catalyzer and the change-agent. The study tries to explore if existing IVs or supports, which are embedded in social-welfare, commercial or public-sector logics, stimulate SI and result in the development of these ideas. The research setting is deliberately selected as a developing country that deals with plenty of IVs and suffers from the lack of ISs; a research setting that exhibits a high degree of heterogeneity and a low institutionalization level. The results indicate that IVs stimulate SIs mostly at the incremental and institutional level where IS is inadequate. The heterogeneity of IVs and a low degree of institutionalization result in the heterogeneity of actions undertaken for SI. Implications for practitioners and scholars are recommended at the end of the paper. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={This chapter presents a systematic review of 50 empirical studies on the social entrepreneurial personality. It aims to answer the question of who social entrepreneurs are in order to help understand why certain individuals but not others create social ventures and persist in their choice. The review findings reveal a focus on four distinct aspects of personality-motivations, traits, identities, and skills-and are based on three approaches: describing the personality of social entrepreneurs, comparing them to another group, and relating personality aspects to outcomes such as strategic choices or performance. The findings offer a multidimensional and refined account of who social entrepreneurs are. Social entrepreneurs are simultaneously driven by a range of motivations and values which include but are not limited to prosocial concerns. Certain extrinsic and intrinsic motivations are shared by commercial and social entrepreneurs. Social and commercial entrepreneurs also seem to exhibit similar entrepreneurial personality traits and benefit equally from transformational leadership skills. Emerging research points to further distinct social traits and identities. Important avenues for future research include paying attention to heterogeneity among types of social entrepreneurs, encouraging more theory-based research, research relating personality to personal and venture-level outcomes, research that considers more dynamic and contextualized perspectives, as well as research on a potential dark side of the social entrepreneurial personality. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

abstract={Purpose – This paper aims to examine the strategic design for entrepreneurial activity. This study examines and evaluates a qualitative Delphi methodology used in a research for the strategy development needs of entrepreneurship counselling and education. The strategic design presented may well apply to non-profit organisations due to the fact that limited resources in funding of non-profit organisations exist. Design/methodology/approach – This paper introduces methodological considerations of applying the Delphi method to the strategy development for an entrepreneurship counselling design, taking Ensimetri – an entrepreneurship counselling organisation in Finland – as a case study, and the potential in applying this strategic design projects to libraries and information management centres. Findings – The research provides a framework on entrepreneurial strategic design. The top ten items that emerged from this research may provide the framework for the development of entrepreneurial strategic design. They may be used to further examine our understanding for the strategy development needs of entrepreneurship counselling and education, as very limited research has taken place on this issue. Issues of culture are discussed. Findings illustrate that respondents would appreciate guidance on the initiation of entrepreneurial activities from the university that are associated with programmes and services provided that may help them on the initiation of entrepreneurial activities. Libraries may use the integrated information systems they employ. This exploratory study found that cultural values may influence entrepreneurship intention. Gender issues are also discussed in regard to the strategic design of entrepreneurial activity, adding to the existing literature for gender differences in attitude. The research provides a framework on entrepreneurial strategic design, and the role of universities with the use of integrated information systems and library services to the initiation of such entrepreneurial activities. Practical implications – Findings of this research may well apply in non-profit organisations such as libraries and information and communication sectors, where in periods of economic crisis, social entrepreneurship can be adopted so that these organisations become profitable. Education has also a role to play in the development of entrepreneurship. Originality/value – The application of the Delphi method to entrepreneurial research, and the use of this design to seek intention and attitudes by and for information professionals and marketers, may in fact contribute to the implementation of social entrepreneurship. Very limited research has taken place to explore entrepreneurial intention. The paper discusses a new methodology which can also be used outside Finland and is of relevance to the information profession. This research makes a theoretical and practical contribution on social entrepreneurial potential and its strategic design. Implications for social entrepreneurship are provided. The implementation of information and communications technologies, the role of social media networks and issues associated with culture are discussed for strategic communication. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Ethical banking, microfinance institutions or certain credit cooperatives, among others, grant socially responsible loans. This paper presents a credit score system for them. The model evaluates social and financial aspects of the borrower. The financial aspects are evaluated under the conventional banking framework, by analysing accounting statements and financial projections. The social aspects try to quantify the loan impact on the achievement of Millennium Development Goals such as employment, education, environment, health or community impact. The social credit score model should incorporate the lender’s know-how and should also be coherent with its mission. This is done using Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM). The paper illustrates a real case: a loan application by a social entrepreneur presented to a socially responsible lender. The decision support system not only produces a score, but also reveals strengths and weaknesses of the application. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

The findings also show that students became more effective at working in teams and in formulating and applying appropriate business strategies for the social enterprises. Overall, the learning-by-doing approach discussed in this paper is capable of developing the entrepreneurial skills of students, but there are challenges that need to be addressed if such an approach is to be effective. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.},

Driven by multiple factors, nonprofit organizations have increasingly turned to social enterprise in the hopes of funding their social missions. However, only limited research has fully delineated how the use of social enterprises affects overall funding and the conditions under which social enterprises are relatively more effective. This mixed-method, three-study project provides evidence that the introduction of a social enterprise negatively affects individual donations but that some of the negative effects can be mitigated when the social enterprise is perceived as mission consistent and competent. In addition, the results show that donor attitudes toward social enterprises moderate the effects. The results of these studies have important implications for marketing, social entrepreneurship, and public policy. © 2012 American Marketing Association.},

abstract={Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to investigate what sort of people become social entrepreneurs, and in what way they differ from business entrepreneurs. More importantly, to investigate in what socio-economic context entrepreneurial individuals are more likely to become social than business entrepreneurs. These questions are important for policy because there has been a shift from direct to indirect delivery of many public services in the UK, requiring a professional approach to social enterprise. Design/methodology/approach – Evidence is presented from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) UK survey based upon a representative sample of around 21,000 adults aged between 16 and 64 years interviewed in 2009. The authors use logistic multivariate regression techniques to identify differences between business and social entrepreneurs in demographic characteristics, effort, aspiration, use of resources, industry choice, deprivation, and organisational structure. Findings – The results show that the odds of an early-stage entrepreneur being a social rather than a business entrepreneur are reduced if they are from an ethnic minority, if they work ten hours or more per week on the venture, and if they have a family business background; while they are increased if they have higher levels of education and if they are a settled in-migrant to their area. While women social entrepreneurs are more likely than business entrepreneurs to be women, this is due to gender-based differences in time commitment to the venture. In addition, the more deprived the community they live in, the more likely women entrepreneurs are to be social than business entrepreneurs. However, this does not hold in the most deprived areas where we argue civic society is weakest and therefore not conducive to support any form of entrepreneurial endeavour based on community engagement. Originality/value – The paper's findings suggest that women may be motivated to become social entrepreneurs by a desire to improve the socio-economic environment of the community in which they live and see social enterprise creation as an appropriate vehicle with which to address local problems. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

This ability becomes even more important in situations of global crises such as that arising from COVID-19. Based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), an explanatory structural model of social entrepreneurial intention was tested, and the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on this intention was evaluated. To do this, a quantitative investigation was conducted using a survey of Spanish university students, obtaining a total of 558 responses: 324 before the COVID-19 crisis and 234 during the crisis period (February and June 2020). The results obtained make it possible to validate the explanatory model of social entrepreneurial intention from the perspective of the TPB. In addition, it shows that social entrepreneurial intention decreases in times of deep socioeconomic crises and high uncertainty, such as that caused by COVID-19. © 2020 by the authors.},

The aim of the paper is to formulate a framework of key competences for social entrepreneurship and to give first insights in how service learning actually has an impact on change in students’ set of competences. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses a mixed-methods approach combining qualitative data collectionmethods of learning diaries of the students and semi-structured interviews, including 40 master’s students studying at a German university in interdisciplinary learning settings and five instructors from the same universities. Analysis was carried out by means of qualitative content analysis. Findings: This paper provides empirical insights about the competences that are being fostered by service learning. From these, a framework for social entrepreneurship competences is being derived. Research limitations/implications: The set of competences should be further investigated, as it was derived out of a small data set. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to use the set of competences for social entrepreneurship as a basis for future research and on a longer-term perspective, which lead to substantial implications for educational practice. Practical implications: This paper includes implications for new perspectives on service learning in the light of the development of a relevant framework for social entrepreneurship competence, having significant implications for educational practice in social entrepreneurship education.

abstract={The sustainability debate in the food sector has exposed the current food system to critics, encouraging the significant growth of Alternative Food Networks (AFNs), new ways of food production, distribution and consumption that aim to shorten the food chain. Our study is focused on Food Assembly (FA), a special kind of AFN combining the culture of social entrepreneurship and digital innovation to achieve sustainability and a high social impact. The coexistence of a digital platform and a weekly farmers' market triggers, within this network, mechanisms of knowledge sharing and self-organisation. To date, however, few studies have focused simultaneously on online and on-site interactions within AFNs, especially with quantitative studies. Our paper aims to test the hypothesis that online and on-site knowledge sharing affects the success of a FA measured by customer sustainable behaviour change. To do so, we developed a quantitative analysis based on a regression model. We collected data via a questionnaire submitted to 8497 Italian FA customers, of which 2115 responses were included in our analysis. The results show that online knowledge sharing significantly affects customer change towards more sustainable purchasing and consumption behaviours, while on-site knowledge sharing positively affects sustainable purchasing behaviours. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={In the face of growing social inequality, social entrepreneurship (SE) is considered to be a sustainable way to account for unmet social needs. Research acknowledges that SE-intention is an important prerequisite for SE-activity but there is only limited knowledge about the mechanisms of SE-intention formation. Despite theories with a cognitive focus like the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) having been shown to be able to predict SE-intention, the influence of an individual’s goal orientations, i.e. one`s personal values, on the choice to pursue a career as a social entrepreneur has been largely neglected. By integrating the TPB and Basic Human Values Theory, we investigate the mechanisms through which personal values are related to SE-intentions. Structural-Equation-Analyses with a sample of German university students (N = 1,326) yielded positive direct effects for the personal value dimensions of openness and self-transcendence, and negative direct effects for conservation and self-enhancement on SE-intention. Furthermore, indirect effects of self-transcendence and self-enhancement via the TPB-components emerged. Further research is needed to consolidate our findings and examine potential intercultural differences of value influences on SE-intention formation. The practical implications are that the educators of potential social entrepreneurs should invest more effort in securing a fit of personal values and the values that reinforce SE. Furthermore, our results highlight that making women aware of the possibility of combining social and financial value goals in SE could increase the number of female entrepreneurs. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={This paper aims at examining academic production on social entrepreneurship, in order to identify approaches and drivers, as well as offer an analytical overview on the topic. Social entrepreneurs are individuals with a social mission, capable of combining practices and knowledge as well as developing partnerships to promote sustainable social change. The weaving of a social mission into an enterprise can bring about social innovation through the development of solutions to long-standing problems and the improvement of the living conditions of a community. The present paper is the result of a systematic survey in the Web of Science database that aimed at analyzing academic production in the area. Its practical and theoretical contributions will allow the construction of a network of themes and the identification of new emerging areas. Moreover, it analyses the dimensions and drivers of social entrepreneurship research, obtaining thus an integrative perspective. It provides also a panoramic assessment of available researches, allowing the authors to identify gaps of knowledge and, consequently, new topics to be investigated. Finally, it can offer a unique perspective for institutions, companies and communities challenged by the need to perform holistic social innovations. The authors propose a research framework that may offer guidance to specialists and researchers willing to investigate the link between dimensions and elements of a social entrepreneurship from a social development point of view. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={We develop a new perspective on capital structure differences between for-profit social and commercial enterprises by combining imprinting and social entrepreneurship theory. Using a longitudinal matched sample, we find that for-profit social enterprises have 40% to 13% lower leverage and up to four times greater leverage stability over time than commercial enterprises. Our results suggest that these differences in capital structure derive from the process of prosocial organizing, which goes beyond the primary focus on financial preferences. Thus, for-profit social enterprises—and similar hybrid organizations, such as B corporations—may require theories adjusted to their context. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={There is a growing consensus that the adoption of performance measurement tools are of particular interest for social enterprises in order to support internal decision-making and to answer the demands of accountability toward their stakeholders. As a result, different methodologies to assess the non-financial performance of social enterprises are developed by academics and practitioners. Many of these methodologies are on the one hand discussions of general guidelines or, on the other hand, very case specific. As such, these methodologies do not offer a functional tool for a broad range of social enterprises. The goal of this article is to fill this gap by developing an instrument suitable for the internal assessment and the external reporting of the non-financial performance of a diverse group of social enterprises. To reach this goal, we used qualitative (focus groups and a Delphi panel) and quantitative research methods (exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis), involving multiple actors in the field of social entrepreneurship. Focusing on five dimensions of organizational performance (economic, environmental, community, human and governance performance), we offer a set of indicators and an assessment tool for social enterprises. © 2016 by the authors.},

This paper contributes with a large-scale empirical analysis at the person level, specifically addressing the match between pursuing sustainable entrepreneurial opportunities and social and environmental concerns of the individuals behaving entrepreneurially. Despite this being a crucial precondition to actually address sustainability challenges by means entrepreneurship for sustainable development, the validity of this tenet has rarely been analysed empirically. Using large-scale survey data to analyse how sustainability orientation relates to entrepreneurial intention aimed at contributing sustainable development, this contribution helps to fill this research gap. Specifically, it shows that sustainability orientation has a positive effect on the pursuance of more sustainability-related entrepreneurial opportunities, but not on entrepreneurial intentions. The implications of these findings for environmental, social, entrepreneurship and sustainability policies are discussed. © 2012, Copyright CCSBE/CCPME.},

abstract={We investigate the research question: Why are there very few social enterprises in China? Our findings unpack four types of institutional challenges to social entrepreneurship, as perceived by social entrepreneurs: norms of a strong role for government; misunderstood or unknown role for social enterprises; non-supportive rules and regulations; and lack of socio-cultural values and beliefs in support of social goals. We contribute to the literature on social enterprises by showing how an institutional environment may be “non-munificent,” i.e., non-supportive for the existence of social enterprises and their goals, and we thus address the need for more attention to the institutional environment in which social entrepreneurship takes place. Further, by using Q-methodology on 42 social entrepreneurs along with illustrative qualitative data from interviews, we address the need to go beyond anecdotal case studies and introduce methodological plurality in social entrepreneurship research. Finally, our findings on institutional challenges provide us with an opportunity to discuss how social entrepreneurs may engage with purposive activities to overcome such challenges, leading us to initiate a conversation between the social entrepreneurship and institutional work literatures. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

Further, income mobility negatively moderates the influence of income inequality on social entrepreneurship, such that the condition of low income mobility and high income inequality is a stronger predictor of social entrepreneurship. We discuss implications and limitations of our study, and we suggest avenues for future research. © 2017, The Author(s) 2017.},

Our empirical case is “impact sourcing”—hybrids in global supply chains that hire staff from disadvantaged communities to provide services to business clients. We identify two major growth orientations—“community-focused” and “client-focused” growth—their inherent tensions and ways that hybrids manage them. The former favors slow growth and manages tensions through highly integrated client and community relations; the latter promotes faster growth and manages client and community relations separately. Both growth orientations address social–business tensions in particular ways, but also create latent constraints that manifest when entrepreneurial aspirations conflict with the current growth path. In presenting and discussing our findings, we introduce preempting management practices of tensions, and the importance of geographic embeddedness and distance to the paradox literature. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={This paper attempts to identify barriers of social entrepreneurship intention by the moderating role of education amongst research universities in Malaysia. Entrepreneurship is regarded as the major factor for economic development while social entrepreneurship is considered as the alternative method of solving social problems. Entrepreneurship is not new for Malaysia as is evident from various policies and programs initiated by the government. However, social entrepreneurship is a relatively new phenomenon in Malaysian context that requires much attention. To promote entrepreneurship we need to know the barriers influencing on entrepreneurship to overcome the barriers and promote new policies and measures to create new ventures. The study used Ajzen's Theory of Planned Behavior as a framework to investigate the barriers of social entrepreneurship intention. Data was collected through questionnaire and confirmatory factor analysis was conducted by using AMOS 18. The multilevel sampling design was used with purposive sampling scheme in Malaysian research universities. The findings of this study show that overall students consider the lack of competency, lack of self-confidence and lack of resources were the barriers that affect social entrepreneurial intentions. Results also show that the social entrepreneurial education moderated the relationship between the perceived barriers and social entrepreneurial intentions of the students. This implies that teaching of social entrepreneurial can help to reduce perceived barriers. Also, the present study premises future directions that a cross country analysis between developing countries and between developed and developing countries can be done to figure out barriers of social entrepreneurship intention amongst students. © 2018 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.},

abstract={Sport policy has increasingly become influenced by corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives aimed at incorporating social, economic and environmental concerns. More recently, sport has incorporated social policies that are entrepreneurial in nature, which has lead to an increase in sports event sponsorship coming from both a social entrepreneurship and CSR perspective. The aim of this study is to analyse the reasons why organisations sponsor sport events at a community level and to identify the drivers that support this decision-making. For this study, 35 public and private sector organisations were involved, from several economic sectors. A questionnaire was applied to the Chief Executive Officers, vice presidents, directors and managers (N = 80) and analysed through an exploratory factor analysis and correlation analysis. The results show for drivers that were most relevant to sports sponsorship policy: customer loyalty and motivation of employees, reputation and social networks, innovation and opportunity, and CSR. The findings are helpful to organisations developing policy initiatives about how to use sports sponsorship to increase their social entrepreneurship and CSR initiatives. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Research on social entrepreneurship has taken an increasing interest in issues pertaining to ideology. In contrast to existing research which tends to couch ‘ideology’ in pejorative terms (i.e., something which needs to be overcome), this paper conceives ideology as a key mechanism for rendering social entrepreneurship an object with which people can identify. Specifically, drawing on qualitative research of arguably one of the most prolific social entrepreneurship intermediaries, the global Impact Hub network, we investigate how social entrepreneurship is narrated as an ‘ideal subject,’ which signals toward others what it takes to lead a meaningful (working) life. Taking its theoretical cues from the theory of justification advanced by Boltanski, Chiapello and Thévenaut, and from recent affect-based theorizing on ideology, our findings indicate that becoming a social entrepreneur is considered not so much a matter of struggle, hardship, and perseverance but rather of ‘having fun.’ We caution that the promise of enjoyment which pervades portrayals of the social entrepreneur might cultivate a passive attitude of empty ‘pleasure’ which effectively deprives social entrepreneurship of its more radical possibilities. The paper concludes by discussing the broader implications this hedonistic rendition of social entrepreneurship has and suggests a re-politicization of social entrepreneurship through a confronting with what Slavoj Žižek calls the ‘impossible.’. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the link between social entrepreneurship and sustainable tourism and to examine the Canadian context in this regard. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology entails a case study approach that includes a thorough review of the related literature and of any existing Canadian sources of hospitality and tourism social entrepreneurship/intrapreneurship projects to determine the state of the Canadian industry with respect to sustainability. Findings: Findings show that there are limited showcased hospitality and tourism social entrepreneurship projects in Canada. Two main assumptions related to the Canadian context can be drawn from this search: (1) There is a lack of hospitality and tourism social entrepreneurship projects and/or, (2) hospitality and tourism social entrepreneurship projects and/or businesses are not recognized and/or there is a lack of awareness of them. Research limitations/implications: This study assessed the situation in Canada and although it was comprehensive under conditions of limited data availability, it cannot speak to social entrepreneurship in sustainable hospitality and tourism globally, which is a future research opportunity. Practical implications: The design of a national incentive program would encourage industry sustainability through tax breaks. This voluntary system would require that firms provide standardized annual reports with their tax filings so that reliable industry data could be collected for analysis and understanding of the sustainability of the industry. Participating firms would be distinguished on a public list. Originality/value: This research has theorized on the connection of social entrepreneurship to sustainable hospitality and tourism such that social entrepreneurship drives sustainable industry growth. This is also the first study of its kind to explore social entrepreneurship’s potential contribution to the sustainability of this industry. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={A country known for its longstanding struggle with corruption and dubious governments may not be the obvious venue for a socio-economic revolution that is expected to play an important role in the elimination of global poverty. However, Paraguay, an 'island without shores', as the writer Augusto Roa Bastos once described it, is home to one of the world's most innovative social enterprises-the Fundación Paraguaya. While its achievements and success are the result of a team effort, its remarkable development can be largely attributed to Martín Burt, the founder and chief executive. We study the case of Fundación Paraguaya-the first and longest-running non-governmental organisation in Paraguay-with two primary research objectives: (1) to analyse the organisation's pioneering way of solving social problems under difficult socioeconomic circumstances and its increasingly global outreach to eradicate poverty; (2) and to analyse the responsible leadership of Martín Burt. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={Recent research has revealed that a large proportion of entrepreneurs start-up their ventures operating on a wholly or partially off-the-books basis. Until now, it has been commonly assumed that those who operate in the informal economy are exclusively commercial entrepreneurs. They are assumed to be rational economic actors who weigh up the benefits of operating off-the-books against the costs of being caught and decide to operate in this manner. The aim of this paper is to evaluate critically this a priori assumption. Reporting evidence from a 2005/6 survey involving face-to-face interviews with 102 informal entrepreneurs in Moscow in Russia, the finding is that such entrepreneurs are not purely commercially driven. Examining their rationales, informal entrepreneurs are found to range from purely rational economic actors pursuing for-profit logics through to purely social entrepreneurs pursuing purely social logics, with the majority somewhere in-between combining both for-profit and social rationales. Neither do their logics remain static over time. What begins as a commercial entrepreneurial venture may become more socially oriented over time or vice versa. So too do their logics vary socio-spatially. Those living in deprived populations are more socially-orientated, whilst those in relatively affluent populations are comparatively more profit-driven. The outcome is a call for a more nuanced explanation of the complex and heterogeneous logics of informal entrepreneurs. © 2011 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC.},

This paper proposes an institutional framework which consists of three main drivers of change: 'government policy', 'resource-mobilization opportunities' and 'social entrepreneurship'. It is argued that the development of cultural tourism was made possible by the unique networks of relationships and associations that underpin music, festival and language fields. This study is situated in the literature on neo-institutional theory, and it draws on a model of change [Seo, M., and Creed-Douglas, W. 2002.

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the concept of opportunity and its role in social entrepreneurship processes. Design/methodology/approach: The paper presents a single-case study of a sustainable community in Denmark. The data include interviews, documents and television programmes. Findings: The case study finds that the opportunity takes a number of different forms in the process. These different forms are the result of a continuous mobilisation of actors. On the basis of these findings a model of social entrepreneurship processes is proposed, where the process is driven by mobilisation and transformation. Research limitations/implications: The findings of the case provide support for a creation view of opportunities and the view that opportunity discovery does not necessarily precede resource mobilisation. The proposed model contributes to the development of the creation view of opportunities as an alternative to the discovery view and to understanding of the role of opportunities in the social entrepreneurship process. Practical implications: The findings suggest that the social entrepreneur is one who actively creates external circumstances rather than responds to opportunities already present therein. This implies a focus on different skills and ways of thinking. Originality/value: The paper presents a model of social entrepreneurship processes grounded in a deep understanding of an empirical setting. The findings and model question the value of the discovery view of opportunities in the field of social entrepreneurship, while contributing to the development of the creation view of opportunities. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

This study recognizes the role of leader passion as a key element for gaining people’s trust in the social enterprise leader and the social mission.

This study focuses on the perceptual factor of financial access that affects entrepreneurial intentions. The study does not cover other in-depth issues of social entrepreneurship such as decision making, leadership, personality traits, social capital, and human capital. To establish an environment with a strong social entrepreneurial intention, a focus on developing perceived access to finance is an extremely important factor.

abstract={Impact sourcing - the practice of bringing digitally-enabled outsourcing jobs to marginalized individuals - is an important emerging social innovation in the outsourcing industry. The impact sourcing model of delivering Information Technology and Business Process Outsourcing (IT-BPO) services not only seeks to deliver business value for clients, but is also driven by an explicit social mission to help marginalized communities enjoy the benefits of globalization. This dual focus has led to the ambitious claim that social value creation can be integral to (and not always by-products of) innovative IT-BPO models. Given the relative newness of the impact sourcing business model there is scarce research about how impact sourcing companies emerge and the process through which entrepreneurs build and operate such companies. This paper draws on a qualitative study of seven Indian impact sourcing companies and develops a process model of the individual-level motivational triggers of impact sourcing entrepreneurship, the entrepreneurial actions underpinning different phases of venture creation and the positive institutional-level influences on impact sourcing. The paper argues that since deeply personalized values are central to the creation and development of impact sourcing companies, the business model may not be easy to replicate. The analysis highlights an intensive period of embedding and robust alliances with local partners as crucial for the scalability and sustainability of the impact sourcing business model. It also emphasizes the role of 'social' encoding and mimicry in determining the extent to which impact sourcing companies are able to retain their commitment to marginalized communities. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Our working hypothesis was that social entrepreneurs present a particular profile related to values of benevolence and self-direction, high entrepreneurship orientation, ability on taking perspective (empathy), a social motive similar to altruism, and career identity based on service and entrepreneurship. We found evidence to maintain our hypothesis and it was possible to characterize social entrepreneurs. The implications of these findings are discussed in this report. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Social entrepreneurship (SE) research has been presented in the literature as a field of action in a pre-paradigmatic state, a field that lacks an established epistemology. Despite that impediment, several qualitative and quantitative studies have already been undertaken on the sole base of some institutions' worldview and without previous solidification of theory. Consequently, critics and social constructivists have found much ambivalence in these and owing to the resulting mess, even question SE's legitimization as a distinctive item of research. Articles on the topic of SE make use of a variety of frameworks, borrowing from neo-institutional or dialectic theory, bringing with them different research methods and views from other disciplines. Instead of proposing another conceptual approach and yet contributing to the ongoing discussion, the authors enact on a deductive journey by examining and clustering underlying paradigmatic assumptions found in a large-scale sample (>300) of current articles. In comparison to results from the management (entrepreneurship) literature, the study finds statistical evidence to the hypotheses that SE differs in researchers' paradigms, that seminal SE research transcends the foci on either detached structures or individuals, and that research in SE is often led by advocacy worldviews of the researchers themselves. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

The results show that the courses offered by most of these business schools had the required social entrepreneurship characteristics. The arrangement of their programs and their teaching methods, which followed the principle of learning by doing, not only enabled the students to balance theory and practice, but also supported the students in creating social enterprises. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Purpose: This paper aims to examine characteristics that contribute to leaders' emergence and development as social advocates in their organizations and communities. Design/methodology/approach: Building on theories of social problems, influence, and impression management, this paper examines how advocacy is affected by needs and situational conditions. Advocacy is the act of supporting an idea, need, person, or group. Advocates use cognitive, emotional, and behavioral strategies to influence attitudes, behaviors, and/or decisions for the benefit of individuals or to promote organizational change and/or social welfare. Social advocacy occurs within organizations in the form of corporate social responsibility, and it occurs within communities in the form of social entrepreneurship. Findings: This theoretical paper argues that motivation of leaders of social ventures is a function of their conviction, self-confidence, and extroversion. Advocates' beliefs about people are likely to shape their advocacy strategies, in particular, their beliefs about whether people are likely to change their attitudes and behavior, are sensitive to possible losses and gain, and respond to information about the probabilities and outcomes of actions and events. Advocate's resilience and transformational abilities (communications and political skills, knowledge of change management, and learning orientation) are predicted to influence their success. Originality/value: The paper discusses directions for management development research and practice to promote involvement in social ventures. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Social entrepreneurship (SE) is perceived as a legitimate and innovative solution to social problems. Yet, when one looks at the literature one finds that the social problems that the SE movement seeks to address and how these problems are identified and defined are not studied. This lack of attention to the defining of social problems in SE has implications for the domain for problems do not exist unless they are recognized and defined, and those that define problems have influence on how these will eventually be addressed. Our paper presents an analysis of framing activities in SE done by the actors involved in the development and promotion of the SE movement. Our analysis reveals that these actors are concerned with creating an ecosystem to support social entrepreneurs. Critical analysis of discourses of these actors reveals a powerful mobilization discourse, one that supports social entrepreneurs as the agents of change. We also find that as the SE movement emerged at the beginning of a cycle of protest against capitalist systems, their framing of SE as system changing of these very systems therefore finds strong resonance with a wide variety of actors. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={The concept of entrepreneurship embedded in the backdrop of business has been increasingly applied to the context of addressing social problems and sustainability challenges. Known as ‘social entrepreneurship’ the topic has garnered the heightened attention of researchers in recent years. As a nascent stream of research social entrepreneurship is still in the early stages of development. Recent evidence suggests a growing body of scholarly research in this field; however, its conceptualisation remains obscure as it is predominantly dictated by definitional arguments. Consequently, the literature is still anecdotal in trying to unveil different dimensions of social entrepreneurship and its potential benefits that might help to battle sustainability challenges. To bridge the existing gap in social entrepreneurship research this study adopts an inductive content analysis approach. Accordingly, a sizeable number of prior studies were extracted from five major databases from 1991 to date. Findings from the prior studies were synthesised in a systematic manner to draw valid conclusions. Based on the findings drawn from prior literature the study also proposes a conceptual framework and prompts further empirical research. The implications of the study are two-fold: academic and practical. The academic implication is primarily to contribute to the relatively uncultivated area of social entrepreneurship literature. The practical implications of the study are potentially instrumental for social entrepreneurs and policy-makers who are involved in social wealth creation. Moreover, the practical implication of the study is deemed to be very significant given the rising impetus of sustainability issues, where it is believed that entrepreneurs can play a vital role in this regard. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

The findings show that the firm's overemphasis on the social employment logic and the increasing disregard of the commercial market logic led to the failure. This imbalance in response to the two competing logics was fuelled by the entrepreneurs’ strong social values, stakeholder reinforcement, and lack of appropriate governance. This study shows that hybrid organizations need to pay attention to the governance of the tension between competing demands inside as well as outside the organization. Hybrid organizations therefore require a hybrid governance model. By presenting a case of failure of a social enterprise, the paper counterbalances the dominance of optimistic idealism in social entrepreneurship literature. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Purpose: This paper aims to examine the interplay among forms of entrepreneurship and the gendered entrepreneurial divide. Using data from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) and the World Values Survey (WVS), the authors investigate the likelihood that females will venture in the commercial entrepreneurial ventures versus social entrepreneurial ventures. The authors draw on the theoretical concept of hegemonic masculinity and emphasized femininity to explain gender variance in the organizational forms of commercial and social entrepreneurship. Specifically, the authors investigate whether pursuing an opportunity in a society that highly values ideologies of hegemonic masculinity and emphasized femininity impacts the probability of venturing in either of these kinds of organizations. Design/methodology/approach: To test the hypotheses, the authors use GEM data from 2009 (n = 14,399) for nascent entrepreneurs and baby businesses owners in 55 counties. They also use the WVS to measure the ideologies of hegemonic masculinity and emphasized femininity at the country level. The authors estimate a logistic multilevel model to identify the drivers of social venturing over commercial venturing. Data are nested by countries, and the authors allow random intercepts by countries with a variance components covariance structure. Findings: The findings demonstrate that there is a divide in entrepreneurial activity, as women entrepreneurs are more likely to start social ventures than commercial ventures. They also find that hegemonic masculinity decreases the incidence of social entrepreneurship, whereas emphasized femininity increases the incidence of social entrepreneurship. Moreover, the authors find evidence that women in societies with a strong view on hegemonic masculinity are less likely to pursue social organizational forms than male entrepreneurs are. Furthermore, in societies with strong views of emphasized femininity, the probability increases that female founders will pursue social organizational forms. The findings highlight the considerable impact of the gender ideologies on entrepreneurship. Research limitations/implications: Although the authors use the terms “gender” and “sex” in this paper interchangeably, they recognize that these two terms are not equivalent. For the purposes of this manuscript, the authors use a gender analysis approach activity based on biological sex to investigate empirical differences in entrepreneurial. The findings suggest that women ultimately, and unintentionally, are consenting to the practices and norms that reiterate the masculinity of entrepreneurship. In this way, the patriarchal ideologies of hegemonic masculinity and masculinization of entrepreneurship ultimately leave women unable to fully take up the identity of “woman” alongside that of “entrepreneur”. Future research can build upon our findings by applying a more nuanced view of gender via constructivist approaches. Originality/value: The findings empirically demonstrate the gendered nature of entrepreneurial activity, leading to specific stereotypical female social organizational forms and male commercial organizational forms. Furthermore, the authors are able to provide theoretical explanations based on hegemonic masculinity and emphasized femininity to understand why social entrepreneurship appeals to women. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Indigenous people in Australia are entrepreneurial by nature because of their ability to use their cultural heritage to create innovative solutions. Part of this creativity stems from indigenous peoples linkage with the land, nature and flora that inspires innovative cooking and food usages. Traditional lands are inseparable from indigenous people in Australia and it is this connection with native herbs, spices and produce that make the food unique. In order to improve the socio-economic development of their people, some indigenous entrepreneurs have started business ventures to capitalise on the international food trend towards locally sourced and grown produce. This paper explores the business development of food enterprises in Australia by focusing on Mark Olive and Indigiearth. These cases are important instances of indigenous entrepreneurship in Australia that highlights the association between the land, nation, families, individuals and communities.

abstract={This research examines the antecedents that motivate and prepare social entrepreneurs to begin social ventures. Drawing from in-depth interviews with 20 social entrepreneurs, this research reveals that there are two paths to social entrepreneurship: the activist path and the business path. Both activist and business social entrepreneurs were motivated by a family legacy or a transformative early adulthood experience as the moral basis for forming a social venture, and both suggested that prior work experience was instrumental in helping them launch their social venture. However, activist social entrepreneurs were likely to form their social venture as a continuation of their ongoing work on a social issue. In contrast, business social entrepreneurs’ first activity on a social issue was to form a social venture. This research suggests that these two different paths to social entrepreneurship result in different types of social ventures. © The Author(s) 2014.},

abstract={Background: UNAIDS has called for greater HIV/syphilis testing worldwide just as local HIV/syphilis testing programs are cut or altered. New models are needed to make HIV/syphilis testing services sustainable while retaining their essential public health function. Social entrepreneurship, using business principles to promote a social cause, provides a framework to pilot programs that sustainably expand testing. Drawing on fieldwork in two South Chinese cities, we examined organizational and financial characteristics of current HIV/syphilis testing systems for men who have sex with men (MSM) in addition to new pilot programs focused on revenue-generation for sustainability. Methods: We undertook a qualitative study to explore organizational and financial characteristics of HIV/syphilis testing for MSM. Data were collected from men who have sex with men and policy stakeholders in Guangzhou and Hong Kong. Framework analysis was used to identify themes and then code the data. Results: Our qualitative research study included MSM and policy stakeholders (n = 84). HIV/syphilis testing services were implemented at a wide range of organizations which we grouped broadly as independent community-based organizations (CBOs), independent clinics, and hybrid CBO-clinic sites. From an organizational perspective, hybrid CBO-clinic sites offered the inclusive environment of an MSM CBO linked to the technical capacity and trained staff of a clinic. From a financial perspective, stakeholders expressed concern about the sustainability and effectiveness of sexual health services reliant on external funding. We identified four hybrid CBO-clinic organizations that launched pilot testing programs in order to generate revenue while expanding HIV testing. Conclusion: Many MSM CBOs are searching for new organizational models to account for decreased external support. Hybrid CBO-clinic organizations create a strong foundation to increase HIV/syphilis testing using social entrepreneurship models in China. © 2014 Tucker et al.},

abstract={This research aims to understand how resource bricolage strategy plays a role in the growth of social enterprises in terms of their product and market. Based on interviews with nine social enterprises, our exploratory finding suggests that social enterprises often employ both internal and network resources in the process of making do. We further explore the relationship between the form of resource utilisation and the nature and scope of activities that the social enterprises embark upon, and find that only those relying on both internal and network bricolage are able to expand into new markets utilising newly developed products. We also find that social enterprises relying on only internal resources can reach the same point through incremental improvisation, by first moving towards either product extension or market expansion, before then embarking on the other. This research contributes to the social entrepreneurship literature by enhancing our understanding of the relationship between resource bricolage strategy and growth of social enterprises through product/ market scope in a penurious environment. The findings of this research also have implications for social enterprise managers and policy makers in utilising their resources and responding to environmental opportunities and challenges. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={This paper explores the role of bricolage in the growth of social entrepreneurship organisations (SEOs). Building on the premises that (1) bricolage is based on the resources at hand and the subjective perspectives that individuals have of these resources, and (2) the characteristics of the top management team (TMT) are an indicator of the resources they make available to the organisation and their ability to put different perspectives into play to interpret resource environments, we seek to determine which configurations of resource endowment, autonomy in the use of resources, TMT diversity and bricolage promote organisational growth. Using a fuzzy-set theoretical technique (fsQCA), we show that the effect of bricolage on organisational growth is contingent on the availability of resources, the degree of autonomy in using these resources and TMT diversity in organisational tenure. Our findings also indicate that TMT gender diversity is not a relevant condition to the growth of SEOs that use bricolage and that TMTs incorporating members with differing levels of previous experience in for-profit organisations exert a negative impact on organisational growth. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Organizations, such as social enterprises, engage in business model innovation when they wish to create, deliver, and capture value for their various stakeholders in ways that effect positive environmental and social change. Despite the increasing research attention paid to social enterprises, the literature on business model innovation in this context is still scarce. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to explore business model innovation driven by sustainability issues at a social enterprise operating in the Scandinavian electricity retail market. A single case study research approach is taken, and data are collected from sixteen individual interviews and two focus groups with executives, managers, and directors. The study contributes to business model innovation as an organizational change process as well as an outcome of this process. The findings show that business model innovation over time at social enterprises reflects a shift in focus from novelty, via lock-in of customers, to efficiency in internal management routines. Additionally, the study concludes that social enterprises with innovative business models driven by sustainability issues can introduce novel practices that lead to changes in the dominant business model of their industry. The study also suggests how social entrepreneurs might innovate their business models as they focus on environmental and social sustainability. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In today's world of increasing ecological, social and economic issues, the question as to how businesses can become a vehicle towards more sustainable development has become more relevant than ever. Crucial to a more sustainable economy is the successful implementation of sustainable practices through entrepreneurial activities. Although there are attempts to describe how sustainable entrepreneurs differentiate themselves, the question of how some entrepreneurs manage to successfully create a sustainable enterprise, while others do not, remains unanswered. The aim of this research is to find causal patterns that explain the success of sustainable entrepreneurs, using their social performance as a measure. Using a configuration approach-based fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) of 598 Austrian small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), we could identify four different combinations of the interconnected variables of innovation orientation, environmental sustainability, resource leveraging and achievement motivation, which all lead to social performance depending on the respective networking intensity of the firms. The only variable that is included in all combinations is environmental sustainability, thus indicating it may be either crucial to or a prerequisite for achieving social performance in SMEs. © 2017 by the authors.},

abstract={This paper examines foundings of human services organizations after natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, wildfires, hurricanes, and tsunamis and explains why only some communities bounce back by founding appropriate collective-goods organizations. Using natural disasters in California counties from 1990 to 2010 as shocks that exogenously impose a need for collective goods over and above the level endogenous to the community, this paper shows that a geographic community’s local organizing capacity rests on the richness of its repertoire of voluntary organizing models as reflected in the diversity of its voluntary associations. Such diversity is even more critical when the type of natural disaster is more unexpected or complex (e.g., both a wildfire and an earthquake) in an area, and the organizational challenges posed are thus more novel for the community. Associational diversity has positive effects on both the numbers and aggregate size of foundings of local (non-branch, secular) human services organizations, and the effects are generalizable to other endogenous demand conditions such as poverty. Results also show how different kinds of variety can have opposing effects on organizing capacity after a disaster, with associational diversity having a positive effect, political diversity having a negative effect, and racial diversity having no significant effect, net of other factors. The paper concludes with a call for treating community resilience as a matter of enhancing local organizing capacity over centralized planning efforts when the environment is rapidly changing. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.},

abstract={Strategic decision making and evaluation in philanthropic giving and social investment requires good-quality information about the social impacts of that investment. One way to meet this need is by calculating a social return on investment (SROI) measure, akin to the return on investment (ROI) approach used in business analysis. Despite much buzz in the field, SROI measurements are rarely used, in part because of the complexity of the calculations but also because of a number of thorny and often expensive organizational challenges associated with implementing an SROI process. This article explores these implementation challenges by comparing four social venture organizations in the health care field-two in the Netherlands and two in the United States-that have utilized some sort of SROI measurement. We summarize the SROI process and identify the specific organizational challenges in each case. Lessons learned from this analysis include the value of process versus product and the importance of fitting the type of measurement to the organizational context. We conclude with a summary of best practices for organizations and social investors who might try to make effective use of SROI measures. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Purpose: The aim of this paper is to report on preliminary research conducted in seven sustainable hospitality and tourism operations set in developing economies which use the principles of social entrepreneurship. The applicability of community-based social entrepreneurial management systems as a means of fostering socio-economic development is analysed. Design/methodology/approach: Online contacts were first made with the selected destinations, who were asked to supply written reports on selected criteria. Purposive sampling was employed, whereby the criteria chosen for analysis were based on characteristics believed to be representative. Analysis of the reports was based on the meaning of words, in particular, in finding commonalities and differences in themes approached by each respondent. Findings: Preliminary conclusions show that the positive effects of employing local indigenous people in these projects far outweigh some negative aspects. Employment possibilities leading to improved living standards have resulted in each case. Local cultural traditions have been maintained and only in a few cases were examples of the negative effects of tourism reported. Research limitations/implications: The findings of this research are limited to a small selection of community-based social entrepreneurial hospitality and tourism projects in developing economies, thus, cannot be applied to similar projects in developed economies, where social and economic factors are considerably different. Originality/value: In developing economies, social entrepreneurs can draw on the success of the projects analysed in this paper for the creation of new, similar ventures. In developed economies, hospitality and tourism businesses wishing to pursue a more socially caring form of development can gain inspiration. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

This article attempts to further enhance our understanding of the management of nonprofit organizations by investigating the way they balance social and business objectives. Over 200 senior managers of nonprofit organizations participated in our structured telephone interview. The data revealed that many organizations worried about the potential for reduced or lost funding, especially during economic hard times. Issues of sustainability usually headed their list of concerns. Many of these organizations sought to establish revenue generating business streams to offset expected funding shortfalls. The data suggested that over 70% of the nonprofit organizations we interviewed resided in the social entrepreneurship zone. Our results also showed that maintaining a social objective and managing a viable business can be complementary and mutually beneficial activities. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={As the literature on social capital has emerged over the past two decades, both advocates and critics of the concept have grappled with the question 'what is the nature of "social capital?"'. By viewing this question through the lens of Austrian capital theory (particularly under Lachmann's influence) we can understand social capital as being structural in nature, made up of heterogeneous and often complementary elements. This way of thinking about social capital opens the door for understanding the role of the 'social entrepreneur' as discovering new combinations within the social capital structure. By carving out a role for the change agent, we see social capital development as a process of social learning that extends the cognitive reach of individuals beyond what they can know directly. An Austrian approach to social capital advances the theoretical debate by linking the literature on network analysis (in which the focus is on individualistic accumulation of social capital) and broader questions of social capital embedded within community-wide norms. Further, an Austrian understanding of social capital informs policy debates, such as the question of whether social capital development can be, or needs to be, part of a deliberate development strategy.},

More specifically, manual text classification is adopted to categorise the text content of sustainability reports based on 17 SDGs, and automatic text mining is employed to further identify the key roles of maritime industry related to each SDG. A unified framework is proposed, which points to varied motives and levels of comprehensiveness of the sustainability efforts by the maritime industry. This framework reveals the theoretic process of maritime industry's transitional involvement in sustainability from the SE perspective. It also creates managerial implications regarding the resource allocation strategies by maritime industry in meeting SDGs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The main purpose of this article is to introduce the Social Enterprise Model Canvas (SEMC), a Business Model Canvas (BMC) conceived for designing the organizational settings of social enterprises, for resolving the mission measurement paradox, and for meeting the strategy, legitimacy and governance challenges. The SEMC and the analysis that explains its features are of interest to academics concerned with the study of social entrepreneurship because they offer a new analytical tool that is particularly useful for untangling and comparing different forms of social enterprises. Also, it is of interest to social entrepreneurs, because the SEMC is a platform that can be used to prevent ‘mission drifts’ that might result from problems emerging from the mismanagement of such challenges. The arguments presented are grounded on scientific literature from multiple disciplines and fields, on a critical review of the BMC, and on a case study. The main features of SEMC that makes it an alternative to the BMC are attention to social value and building blocks that take into consideration non-targeted stakeholders, principles of governance, the involvement of customers and targeted beneficiaries, mission values, short-term objectives, impact and output measures. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

abstract={Purpose: Social ventures are unique and important for society; yet, we know very little about their business models. The purpose of this paper is to: re-conceptualize extant business model frameworks so that they can analyze social ventures; identify the key characteristics of social ventures; and identify the typology of effective social venture business model configurations. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses resource dependence theory to make sense of extant business models and borrows from public administration literature to identify key characteristics and different configurations of social venture business models. Findings: The paper re-conceptualizes business model frameworks as inter-organizational arrangements to cope with external resource dependence; this paper also identifies four key characteristics of social ventures, and develops a social venture business model typology based on these unique key characteristics and extant business model dimensions. Research limitations/implications: The typology may guide further social venture research, e.g. research on social venture business model creation, on social venture business model innovation, and on social change. Limitations and boundary conditions are discussed in the paper. Practical implications: The research may further help social entrepreneurs to develop effective business models that meet the social and financial objectives. Originality/value: The paper offers a novel reconceptualization of traditional business model frameworks, a unique set of key characteristics of social ventures, and a theoretical typology of effective social venture business model configurations. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={There is increasing scholarly attention toward understanding how enterprises seeking prosocial impact organize their practices. However, this research has primarily explained changes in isolated practices and has not fully explored the mechanisms for such changes. This omission is relevant for social entrepreneurship scholars who seek to better understand how practices operate not simply internally but can effect a positive impact. We address this omission by drawing from a unique longitudinal dataset – assessment scores of enterprises seeking to be certified and recertified as B Corporations (B Corps). We also conducted 24 interviews with B Corp leaders, B Lab staff, and venture fund managers. We found that B Corps shifted their practice configurations as they underwent assessment and reassessment for certification. We also found that exogenous factors such as size and sector, and endogenous factors such as the nature of practices explained shifts in practice configurations. Our contribution is twofold. First, we test deductive claims that social enterprises re-organize for impact. We show that enterprises update their practice configurations over time. Second, we propose an inductively derived theoretical framework with three building blocks: affordability, interpretability, and social referents to explain the shifts in practice configurations. Executive summary: We challenge and complement the prevailing assumption that social enterprises incrementally and/or independently improve their practices to achieve their initially intended impact. To do so, we empirically derive a configural framework of how prosocial impact practices evolve over time. In addition, we know from existing research that cues and peers available in prosocial categories, such as B Corporations, provide enterprises with different choices for organizing for impact. However, the existing research only offers a limited understanding of the specific mechanisms that facilitate change in organizational practices. We conducted four studies to better understand how cues, peers, and other mechanisms lead to changes in practice configurations. We used B Impact Assessment (or BIA) data from 346 enterprises assessed between 2008 and 2011 (Wave 1) and 723 enterprises assessed between 2011 and 2013 (Wave 2), all based in the U.S. In addition, we used longitudinal data for a subset of 159 enterprises present in both waves. We also conducted 24 interviews with leaders from certified B Corps, venture capital fund managers, and a B Lab staff member. We found that B Corps change their practices over time, and this change is seen in shifts in practice configurations as the enterprises undergo assessment and re-assessment for certification. We also found that exogenous factors such as size and sector, and endogenous factors such as the nature of practices and their interaction with the enterprise's unique context explain shifts in practice configurations. Our contribution is twofold. First, we test deductive claims that social enterprises re-organize for impact by updating their configuration of practices over time. Second, we propose an inductively derived theoretical framework with three building blocks: affordability, interpretability, and social referents to explain the shifts in practice configurations. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

Some factors seem obvious and are measurable, while other factors, such as entrepreneurship and, especially social entrepreneurship, are tacit and hard to measure. Anyway, social entrepreneurship is accepted globally as a bridge between business and benevolence. It attempts to find solution to local sustainability issues that are normally not addressed by traditional organizations. The problems faced by the Middle East society in general and Saudi Arabia in particular is unique in nature. Most of such problems cannot be addressed by the Government or the traditional organisations. The utility of social entrepreneurship arises here. There are many social enterprises in Saudi Arabia that have succeeded in nurturing a band of new leaders who are attempting to enhance the region's global competitiveness, with a social touch. The present paper presents a few social entrepreneurs who have made their mark in Saudi society, and provides suggestions for nurturing and sustaining social entrepreneurships.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyze and understand the business logic of the for-profit social enterprises targeting the basic needs of the base of the pyramid (BoP) segment. A case study of an organization offering clean energy solutions to the BoP segment has been used to illustrate the socio-economic business model of the for-profit social enterprises, which can serve the underserved needs of the BoP segment using an inclusive approach. Design/methodology/approach: This paper analyses Selco, a social enterprise offering energy solutions to the low-income population in rural India. The qualitative case-based research involves the secondary data inputs from the online sources and primary data inputs from the field interviews with the different stakeholders at Selco. Findings: The research findings recommend the following strategic choices for the social enterprises – focus on segmentation; field-based experimentation, innovation and prototyping; local skill-building and engagement; hybrid organizational setup; systemic behavior change orientation; customized value offerings; last-mile delivery and support; and collaboration with non-traditional stakeholders. Practical implications: The lessons learnt through the analysis of Selco provide tools and strategies to enable the social enterprises to better understand their business model and make informed decisions resulting in the effective social interventions while remaining sustainable. The paper offers an actionable framework for creating an inclusive formal market ecosystem that is sustainable, scalable and socially relevant. Originality/value: This study is an original contribution to the field of social entrepreneurship. It undertakes a field study of the social enterprise delivering inclusive energy solutions to the BoP segment in India. The study of Selco brings out the learnings regarding the key strategic actions, which can lead to sustainable business models for targeting the BoP segment in developing countries like India © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={PurposeThis paper aims to investigate whether the sustainable livelihoods approach (SLA) enables an analysis of the complex interrelations and interdependencies between social entrepreneurs (SEs), destination communities’ livelihood assets and related transforming structures and processes. SEs in tourism are regarded as drivers for linking destination communities with enterprises, aiming to create economic benefits and livelihoods. Design/methodology/approachData were gathered through participatory action research at a tourism lodge and its foundation, which facilitated agricultural training, and by conducting in-depth interviews with ten key stakeholders. The sustainable livelihoods framework (SLF) served as the theoretical framework. FindingsThe SLA enables an analysis of interrelations and interdependencies between various stakeholders and to visualise the way SEs forge the impacts tourism has on livelihoods. The agricultural project did not reach its full potential because of, amongst other factors, competing aims between the profit and non-profit business, resulting in the lack of a clear vision and strategy. Additional challenges were dependency on external funding and a lack of reciprocal communication between the stakeholders involved. Research limitations/implicationsThis research is based on one case study, and findings cannot be generalised. Future studies should develop the SLF further, possibly through adaptation and integration of other tools. Practical implicationsThe SLF enables researchers to integrate local knowledge and participatory research methods, thus facilitating engagement and learning between different stakeholders. Originality/valueThrough empirical research, this paper adds valuable insights into the applicability of the SLF in the context of social entrepreneurship in tourism. © 2016, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the formation of social entrepreneurial intentions (SEIs) in postgraduate students in the South-East European region. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative approach (self-administered online questionnaire) is used to gather data. The total number of the questionnaires that were collected and analyzed through SPSS statistical suite was 115 from which 111 were valid. Findings: From the proposed five hypotheses set in the literature, only the personality trait theory was totally rejected because it failed to predict social and commercial entrepreneurial intentions (EIs). The remaining hypotheses were found to be valid. The study’s key finding is that the chosen theory (Ajzen’s theory of planned behavior (TPB)), is able to predict both kinds of intentions. An alarming key finding is that tensions in mission focus seem to be present in the early shaped intentions of potential social entrepreneurs. Research limitations/implications: Research findings impose that major educational and policy efforts are needed to promote the theme of social entrepreneurship (SE). The results indicate that most of the postgraduates have not yet fully understood the mindset of SE as they were confused about the synergy of the goals (inherent in their social vs profit intentions). Originality/value: This research contributes in three major ways to the literature. First, it shows that SEIs seem to be shaped similarly to EIs; determined mostly by two of the motivational factors of the TPB (personal attitude and perceived behavioral control). Second, it shows which factors seem to affect both constructs and third, it adds to the literature by showing that tensions in mission focus are evident early on in the intentions’ formation process, underlying the necessity of immediate educational and legislative precautions. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Design/methodology/approach: This research applies a comparative case study design in combination with a review of the literature in order to present a model of corporate social entrepreneurship. Findings: The case study of two major projects within the Odebrecht group allows us to design a model of corporate social entrepreneurship explaining how the company transforms external triggers such as socio-environmental risks into sustainability innovations, creating competitive advantages. Research limitations/implications: The two case studies provide some evidence of how companies blend sustainability and innovation within corporate social entrepreneurship strategies. More research is needed in order to refine the patterns and components of the corporate social entrepreneurship model. Practical implications: Integrating sustainability into the innovation process allows Odebrecht to differentiate itself from competitors and have meaningful engagement with stakeholders. This helps the company to grow, especially in developing economy markets, which face similar sustainability challenges as Latin America.

abstract={Although increasingly complex, modern innovation is still largely viewed through the lenses of sectors and distinct venues-e.g. large corporate R&D and new product development, entrepreneurial small or new ventures, or public programs or projects. However, Cleantech innovation is different-more blended, networked and boundary spanning. Social entrepreneurship and grassroots activism are also important. To understand such innovation emerging Cleantech activity in New York City-triggered by growing environmental concerns and opportunities due to rising energy costs-is studied. At a general level, Cleantech innovation decision making is viewed as a collaborative, complex set of activities involving diverse social entrepreneurs, grassroots movements, firms, public policy actions and hubs of innovation-all encompassing varied sectors and institutions and as a whole representing diverse individual backgrounds and motivations. Three grassroots NYC-based Cleantech endeavors are contrasted: vision42-a well-defined citizen-centric effort; Green Drinks NYC-a networking endeavor with no identifiable center (resembling a "meet-up"); and GREEEN.US-a fluid movement emanating from a university-based incubator and comprising diverse entrepreneurs, community activists, faculty, corporate executives and public officials. The lessons learned for Cleantech innovation and for modern innovation generally are then developed, focusing especially on the roles of social entrepreneurship and grassroots activism. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Faced with competition and resource constraints, nonprofit social purpose organizations (SPOs) are increasingly pursuing business model innovation (BMI) to progress their dual – social and economic – value-creation focus. Reflecting this interest, the BMI literature in the SPO context has grown in significance, yet remains fragmented and in need of a conceptual framework to facilitate the development of a unified body of knowledge. Addressing this need, our conceptual framework captures antecedents and moderators driving and shaping BMI-based creation in nonprofit SPOs. We theorize that nonprofit SPOs pursuing BMI build learning capabilities that will provide new knowledge configurations to undertake BMI and achieve greater dual value creation. While this process is driven by their dual value creation focus and perceived environmental uncertainty, a set of internal and external factors moderate the suggested relationship between BMI and dual value creation. We discuss implications of our framework for theory, future research, and practice. © 2019},

abstract={An increasing number of social ventures are for-profit companies (i.e., forprofit social ventures) that seek to advance a social cause while making a profit. In a series of seven studies, this research investigates consumer support for organizations as a function of their social mission and profit orientation. The impact of profit orientation on consumer support depends on the prominence of the organization's social mission. For organizations with a prominent social mission, profits are interpreted as a signal of greed; absent a prominent social mission, a for-profit orientation can instead imply greater competence. As a result, consumer support of for-profit social ventures suffers in comparison to both nonprofits and traditional for-profits-a downside to the organizational benefits of for-profit social ventures identified in prior research. In addition, this research investigates organizational factors-including excessive organizational spending, profit perceptions, and operational efficiency cues-that alter greed perceptions and consequently support for for-profit social ventures. Together, this research sheds light on consumer reaction to organizations that support social causes, with implications for the social venture marketplace, including the nonprofit versus for-profit quandary faced by social entrepreneurs. © The Author 2017.},

abstract={This paper argues that social enterprises (SE) in EU Member States share at least following common features: the dominance of a social or societal objective over market goal, an apparent social responsibility, particularly in the field of profit distribution. However, numeric limits for the criteria of SE identification remain 'unclear': in the majority of cases there are no comprehensible requirements regarding the employment of vulnerable groups and the reinvestment of profits into social projects. Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Finland, Italy, Lithuania, and Slovakia advocate accuracy and precision in dealing with the terminology surrounding SE regulatory and legal acts to the greatest extent. Being a significant facilitator of sustainable development, SE growth has a close relationship with certain macroeconomic factors. Our correlation and regression analysis clearly proves that there are certain factors of financial and social environment which have the greatest impact on the increase of the number of SE per 10,000 population, namely: Monetary Freedom, Income Distribution and Helping a Stranger. The first two factors show the impact of government regulation quality in business relation, including the links between employers and employees. The latter factor demonstrates an average social perception of so-called 'inclusion ideas' in different societies.},

abstract={PurposeAlthough the generation of social value is the focus of social entrepreneurship, little research attention is paid on how social value and transformation can be created. By adopting a market approach, this study aims to develop a framework showing how social enterprises in tourism/hospitality can generate social value and transformation. Design/methodology/approachA thorough literature review revealed that a market approach is an appropriate lens for understanding social entrepreneurship. Consequently, a framework based on “learning with the market” is proposed as a useful tool for identifying, managing and also creating (new) opportunities for social ventures. The justification and the theoretical underpinnings of the market-based framework are further supported by discussing various other theories and concepts. FindingsThe framework identifies three capabilities that social entrepreneurs need to develop for generating social value and transformation: network structure, market practices and market pictures. Several examples from tourism and hospitality social enterprises are analyzed for showing the applicability and usefulness of the framework. Research limitations/implicationsThe paper proposes a conceptual framework as well as several research directions for further testing, refining and expanding it. Practical implicationsBy applying the framework on several tourism and hospitality social enterprises, the paper provides practical implications about the capabilities that social enterprises should develop for engaging with other market actors to identify and exploit (new) market opportunities for social value co-creation, and influence market plasticity for forming new markets and driving social change. Social implicationsThe suggested framework identifies the capabilities and the ways in which (tourism/hospitality) social enterprises can engage with and form markets for co-creating social value and escalating their social impacts through social transformation. Originality/valueThe paper provides a new marketing approach (that overcomes the limitations of traditional economic theories) for understanding how social enterprises can shape, manage and engage with social markets for generating social value. © 2016, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Although social entrepreneurs’ actions have been highlighted as an important source of novelty and innovations, this issue has largely been under-researched so far in the field of entrepreneurship. In this paper, we explore the role of social entrepreneurs’ bricolage behavior in enabling the creation of innovations within resource-constrained environments, called ‘catalytic innovations’. In addition, we investigate situations in which an over-reliance on bricolage may hamper social entrepreneurs’ ability to look for new resources crucial to bring about social change. We tested our hypotheses on 113 social entrepreneurs using an online questionnaire survey. We find that the positive relationship between bricolage and catalytic innovations and scale/growth changes beyond a point, suggesting a curvilinear (quadratic) effect of bricolage. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={The concepts of sustainable development and social economy are currently undergoing a process of convergence, determined by the extension of the concept of sustainability and the role of social enterprise. In a context in which the primary focus of management literature, especially of North American origin, concerns the concept and practices of social entrepreneurship, this paper explores the experiences of European social enterprises and in particular of Italian social cooperatives. Social cooperatives are experimenting with initiatives capable of responding to the emergence of new needs and changes in society in a sustainable way. Based on an analysis of the experience of various social cooperatives operating in the field of renewable energy sources, tourism, and the use of assets confiscated from the Mafia, this paper aims to highlight how social enterprise manages to create contexts of sustainable development, thereby building interorganizational and intersectoral collaborative networks aimed at the activation of new paths for local development. This represents evidence of the specific nature of the social enterprise, which is able to establish a number of coordination mechanisms. It creates new businesses with public and private, and profit and non-profit partners, with the aim of achieving a stated goal, or enters into contractual arrangements, in order to establish business partnerships and build entire local manufacturing supply chains. In this way social enterprise promotes interaction between resources of a public, market and community nature. © 2017 The Authors Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics © 2017 CIRIEC},

It shows how different types of school meal arrangement influence the social life of a school class, and how these arrangements involve strategies of both inclusion and exclusion. Two types of school meals are compared in the intervention study: a hot meal based on Nordic ingredients and the normal Danish school meal arrangement in which children bring lunch packs to school. The study discusses commensality by examining and comparing lunchtime interactions within the same group of children in the two contrasting meal situations. The results fail to confirm the conventional view that shared meals have greater social impacts and benefits than eating individualized foods. The article argues that the social entrepreneurship involved in sharing individual lunch packs might even outweigh some of the benefits of shared meals where everyone is served the same food. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.},

Drawing from explanatory case studies of two social enterprises-Waste Concern (Bangladesh) and Seven Women (Nepal)-the findings suggest that social entrepreneurs act as bricoleurs to integrate their operant and operand resources in subsistence marketplaces to facilitate inclusive growth. The authors further connect with and extend three discourses of research-social entrepreneurship, social bricolage, and service-dominant logic-to develop a framework providing insights into the "bottom-up" approach, the underlying dynamics of shared value creation, and inclusive growth in subsistence marketplaces by social entrepreneurs. The findings also strengthen Dees's (2001) definition of social entrepreneurship, confirming its applicability and relevance in subsistence marketplaces and further extending the theory of social bricolage. The authors discuss the implications of these findings, including tactical interventions aimed at providing better understanding of how social entrepreneurs create value in resource constrained marketplaces, from a bottom-up perspective. © 2015, American Marketing Association.},

Curiously, the debate has largely centred on 'philanthrocapitalists' and philanthropic professionals, while less attention has been devoted to the ways in which the newly emergent philanthropic ideologies and practices are 'marketed' to and adopted by the broader audience of philanthropic givers. In response, we explore the ideological elements that make lending through Kiva, an emergent microfinance charity, meaningful to its creators and supporters. A combination of interpretive methods is used to outline Kiva's ideology of entrepreneurial philanthropy. This utopian ideology is found to legitimize 'marketized' philanthropic practices by invoking alternative conceptions of poverty, social progress and philanthropy (i.e. representations of philanthropic giving, philanthropic benefactors and beneficiaries and the relations between them). © The Author(s) 2013.},

abstract={Urban social entrepreneurs have been suggested to play an essential part in the success of local health promotion initiatives. Up to now, roles like these have only been identified in retrospect. This prospective collaborative study explored the possibilities of institutionalizing a comparable role for a 'health broker' in four Dutch municipalities as an additional investment to promote health in deprived neighbourhoods. The theoretical notions of public and policy entrepreneurs as well as of boundary spanners were adopted as a reference framework. Documents produced by the collaborative project served as input for a qualitative analysis of the developments. We succeeded in implementing a 'health broker' role comparable to that of a bureaucratic public entrepreneur holding a formal non-leadership position. The role was empowered by sharing it among multiple professionals. Although positioned within one sector, the occupants of the new role felt more entitled to cross sectoral borders and to connect to local residents, compared to other within-sector functions. The 'health broker' role had the potential to operate as an 'anchoring point' for the municipal health sector (policy), public health services (practice) and/or the local residents (public). It was also possible to specify potential 'broking points', i.e. opportunities for health promotion agenda setting and opportunities to improve cross-sectoral collaboration, citizen participation and political and administrative support for health promotion efforts. The 'health broker' role we developed and implemented reflects the notion of systematic rather than individual entrepreneurship. Such a collective entrepreneurship may create additional opportunities to gradually strengthen local health promotion efforts. © The Author (2010).},

abstract={Although a small literature has recently emerged that highlights the existence of social entrepreneurship, the idea that entrepreneurship and enterprise culture might be other than profit-driven capitalist endeavour is seldom entertained. Instead, enterprise culture is widely viewed as a by-word for contemporary capitalist culture. The aim of this article is to evaluate critically this dominant narrative. To do this, GEM's UK Social Entrepreneurship Monitor is used to compare the levels and ratios of commercial-to-social entrepreneurship across various population groups and areas in the UK. The finding is that one-third of all entrepreneurs are driven primarily by social goals rather than profit, and that cultures of entrepreneurship markedly vary across population groups and areas, with rural and marginalized populations displaying a greater propensity to engage in social rather than profit-driven entrepreneurship. The article concludes by discussing the public policy implications of this finding that enterprise cultures are not everywhere and always profit-driven, raising questions not only about whether the promotion of profit-driven entrepreneurship in marginalized populations is akin to parachuting in an alien enterprise culture but also whether a focus upon social entrepreneurship might promote greater inclusiveness in the enterprise culture agenda than is currently the case. © SAGE Publications, Inc. 2007.},

abstract={In socialist China, rapid aging, severe shortage of public provisions for frail elders, and the state's admitted failure to meet vast unmet needs have led the state to promote the use of non-profits as a key peg of welfare policy for the elderly. To this end, the Chinese government passed the Provisional Regulation on the Registration and Management of Civilian-run Non-enterprise Units in 1998 to set out the legal framework. Using tax exemption and preferential utility charges as baits, the 1998 decree encourages the birth of nonprofits to meet the shortfall in social services. The sharp rise in nonprofit organizations (NPOs) after 1998 suggests the policy is achieving its intended effect. However, the insistence on self-sufficiency and ban on profit taking means that such agencies have to operate as social enterprises, combining their social mission with an entrepreneurial mode of management as they rely on fee charges as the primary income source. The paper begins by examining the policy and demographic contexts for old age care and the concepts NPOs, social enterprises and social entrepreneurship. It then presents research findings on the agency profiles and operational experiences of 137 non-state care homes in three Chinese cities. This is followed by an analysis of the motives for social entrepreneurship, namely family circumstances, personal attributes, social commitment, and entrepreneurial drive. The final part discusses the link between the nonprofit policy, NPO attributes and social entrepreneurship. It is argued that it is the peculiarity of the existing policy that attracted a very special group of social investors into the old age care business.},

abstract={Sustainable entrepreneurship is raising and already providing a response to environmental, social and economic issues. However, it is still at disadvantage when seeks funding from traditional providers of capital. Crowdfunding has opened a new possibility for closing such funding gap. This study investigates the role of crowdfunding as a creative source of capital for ventures with sustainable orientation. The analysis seeks to understand to what extent project characteristics influence the ability to raise funds on the world leading reward-crowdfunding platform, and, importantly, to explain their survival post-campaign. Results show that the perceived sustainable mission positively influences the outcome of the campaign. An average survival rate over 70% after one year of operations suggests the creation of healthy sustainability ventures through crowdfunding. Furthermore, a higher percentage of female co-founders improves the chances of success during and after the crowdfunding campaign. The paper discusses implications for the success of crowdfunding campaigns and their development post-campaign in sustainable entrepreneurship. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide a better understanding of how the interplay of individual-level resources and culture affects entrepreneurs’ propensity to adopt social value creation goals. Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of 12,685 entrepreneurs in 35 countries from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, it investigates the main effects of individual-level resources – measured as financial, human and social capital – on social value creation goals, as well as the moderating effects of the cultural context in which the respective entrepreneur is embedded, on the relationship between individual-level resources and social value creation goals. Findings: Drawing on the resource-based perspective and Hofstede’s cultural values framework, the results offer empirical evidence that individual-level resources are relevant for predicting the extent to which entrepreneurs emphasise social goals for their business. Furthermore, culture influences the way entrepreneurs allocate their resources towards social value creation. Originality/value: The study sheds new light on how entrepreneurs’ individual resources influence their willingness to create social value. Moreover, by focussing on the role of culture in the relationship between individual-level resources and social value creation goals, it contributes to social entrepreneurship literature, which has devoted little attention to the interplay of individual characteristics and culture. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Entrepreneurship as a field of research has increasingly attracted the attention of researchers for decades. In particular, social entrepreneurship is emerging as a research area that is attracting increased research interest among researchers globally. Among the various factors which influence social entrepreneurship intentions is attitude, risk taking propensity and proactive personality. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of attitude, risk taking propensity and proactive personality on social entrepreneurship intentions among university students. A quantitative research approach was adopted for the study. A questionnaire was administered to two hundred and ninety four (n=294) students from selected universities in the Gauteng province, South Africa. Multiple linear regression was used to assess the influence of attitude, risk taking propensity and proactive personality on social entrepreneurial intentions. Preliminary analyses were conducted to ensure no violation of assumptions of normality, linearity, multicollinearity and homoscedasticity. Upon testing the significance of the independent variables, the results showed that in the model, only two variables were statistically significant, with risk taking propensity showing a higher beta value (beta = .540, p= <.000) than attitude towards entrepreneurship scale (beta = .259, P<.000). In order of importance, these results mean that risk taking propensity represented the most unique contribution towards social entrepreneurial intentions followed by attitude. Proactive personality did not make a unique contribution. It was concluded that social entrepreneurial intentions of university students are driven by their attitude and willingness to take risks. © 2017, Czestochowa University of Technology.

abstract={Corporate Social Responsibility expresses a situation in which companies adopt a broader business view assuming their impact on society. While some firms start to develop their strategies focusing on responsibility, recent discussions in the Higher Education Institutions query the contribution of University Social Responsibility. Nowadays, Universities should not only do some add-on philanthropic things, but should change their strategies and really build a responsible approach into their management activities and also into their education and research programs. In this research paper we propose a modelling framework for student base analysis in order to test whether Higher Education Institutions use a long-term horizon perspective and involve all stakeholders in their strategy, especially students, to be able to optimize their positive impact in society and also to reduce negative impact if needed. Supported by the scarce academic literature in the field, selected indicators are determined to build constructs related to University Social Responsibility and to develop a structural model able to explain their relationship of causality with students’ satisfaction. The conclusion after the statistical analysis procedure applied to a sample of 392 students in courses devoted to Business Management at the university in Brazil is positive, confirming the hypotheses developed in the conceptual model. In addition, the internal social entrepreneur at the University emerges as a driver of change, as a guarantee of endogenous development of responsibility. To finish some suggestions emerge for the future research agenda in the field. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={This paper explains the processes behind the framing of drip irrigation as a promising technology to address current poverty and environmental challenges in the developing world. I draw from critical development and science and technology studies and highlight that this imagery has been actively performed. Insiders elaborated a compelling narrative calling upon a will to improve through technology and the moral legitimacy of social entrepreneurship in development; they worked hard to establish a supportive coalition in an ever wider network. This story hinges on several assumptions, which upon closer scrutiny appear to be problematic: the unicity of smallholder farming, the attribution of inherent technical characteristics to a specific object-the "drip kit"-regardless of the context in which it is used, and the framing of social entrepreneurship and market-based approaches as alternative models even though these rather constitute a re-working of existing arrangements within the international development community. Nonetheless, the pro-poor and environmentally friendly smallholder drip irrigation narrative still continues to be successful in harnessing the support of the international development community, despite the little capacity drip irrigation has had to transform smallholder farming, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Unpacking the origins, actors, and building blocks of the discursive success of smallholder drip irrigation provides fresh perspectives on the practices of development in the sector and is the first step toward more meaningful engagement with smallholder farmers in the developing world. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

Design/methodology/approach: The authors apply liberal feminist, socialist feminist and transnational/post-colonial feminist perspectives to critically examine issues of gender in the field of social entrepreneurship. Findings: By way of three distinct feminist lenses, the analyses suggest that the social entrepreneurship field does not recognize gender as an organizing principle in society. Further to this, a focus on women within this field replicates problematic gendered assumptions underlying the field of women’s entrepreneurship research. Practical implications: The arguments and suggestions provide a critical gender perspective to inform the strategies and programmes adopted by practitioners and the types of research questions entrepreneurship scholars ask. Social implications: The authors redirect the conversation away from limited status quo approaches towards the explicit and implicit aim of social entrepreneurship and women’s entrepreneurship: that is, economic and social equality for women across the globe.

In fact, a large body of theoretical developments that occurred in the fields of innovation, territorial development, social economics, and public governance (among others) have emphasised the need to adopt new approaches to new (or emerging) problems, such as: climate change; chronic diseases; increasing inequalities in income distribution; high rates of unemployment (particularly among young people); the impact of ageing population; and mass urbanisation and social exclusion phenomenon. This chapter aims at contributing to this literature by making an attempt to distinguish both concepts: social innovation and social entrepreneurship.

abstract={Purpose: Understanding of social values is emerging, particularly as the phrases "social impact" and "social value" and the measurement thereof, are ubiquitous in both practitioner and academic discourse today. These terms are particularly relevant to those involved in social initiatives that are required at some stage to demonstrate to stakeholders, investors, funders, or simply themselves that they have the capability to deliver. The purpose of this paper is to link the evaluation of social enterprise outcomes to individual efficacy beliefs. Design/methodology/approach: The study is survey based (165 respondents) and conducted in two major cities in South Africa, where social entrepreneurship (SE) has unequivocal application. Social outcomes and self-efficacy are operationalized and measured along multi-dimensional scales. After checking the instruments for validity and reliability, correlational and multiple regression analyses are performed to determine the predicted relationship between the specified variables. Findings: Empirical findings reveal that evaluation of social enterprise outcomes is associated with higher levels of self-efficacy. Significant results support the propositions that perceptions of capability are positively related to implementing a social vision, sustainability, social networking, innovativeness and financial returns. Research limitations/implications: The main implications of this study are that measuring SE efficacy in advance of funding may indicate probability of venture success. Originality/value: The study is one of the first to provide a much needed account of the evaluation of social enterprises in relation to self-efficacy in an emerging market context. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={This chapter examines the nature, contextual and dispositional antecedents, contingent behavioral consequences, and moderating effects of prosocial motivation at work. Prosocial motivation-the desire to protect and promote the well-being of others-is distinct from altruism and independent of self-interested motivations. Key antecedents include relational job design, collectivistic norms and rewards, transformational leadership, and individual differences in other-oriented values, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Prosocial motivation more strongly predicts persistence, performance, and productivity when it is intrinsic rather than extrinsic; citizenship behaviors when it is accompanied by impression management motivation; and performance when manager trustworthiness is high. Prosocial motivation strengthens the relationships of intrinsic motivation with creativity, core self-evaluations with performance, and proactive behaviors with performance evaluations. Future directions include studying the conditions under which prosocial motivation fuels unethical behavior and harm-doing, collective prosocial motivation, behavior as a cause rather than consequence of prosocial motivation, new organizational antecedents of prosocial motivation, and implications for social entrepreneurship, corporate social responsibility, and the natural environment. © 2012 by Oxford University Press, Inc.

abstract={Social entrepreneurship-a new business model that combines a social goal with a business mentality-is in a transitional phase, from a rough cowboy market to a more established market niche. This process results in two interconnected dilemmas for the social entrepreneur. First, how it can capture market share despite its role as an antagonist to current market values. Second, how it can prevent the loss of its own core values in the course of greater interaction with the incumbent regimes. Using a tool known from innovation sciences to analyse radical innovations, namely strategic niche management, and both survey data and interviews from actors in the Netherlands, this article shows that social entrepreneurs have an attitude that is still more in line with the cowboy market than with the new diplomatic role they are expected to take on. Subsequently, it provides recommendations on how to achieve this new attitude. © 2010 The Author(s).},

abstract={Purpose - This paper aims to examine the institutional and social determinants, and consequences of social entrepreneurship with respect to China's rural enterprises. It also attempts to provide a conceptual framework concerning how rural Chinese enterprises act as social entrepreneurial institutions and contribute to both business development and social welfare of local communities. Design/methodology/approach - The conceptual framework is developed through a critical review of literature and an integration of multiple disciplinary studies, with a focus on the perspectives of institutional governance, managerial networks, and market orientation. Findings - The study identifies three framework layers for the development of China's rural enterprises, which are fundamentally driven by market preserving authoritarianism, local state corporatism, community culture, social entrepreneurship and market orientation. Practical implications - The proposed framework can help contribute to the theoretical development of strategic issues of social entrepreneurship in transitional economies. It may also provide insights about local state governance, ownership structures and market competition in China. Originality/value - As China's rural enterprises are widely regarded as a phenomenon related to the core nature of a "socialist market economy", an ideology embraced since the beginning of Chinese social-economic reforms, a study of institutional and entrepreneurial nature of this kind serves as a stepping stone for understanding the emerging phenomenon of the country's social entrepreneurship, which is characterized by open market mechanisms and socialist legacies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Background. Collaborations are important to health promotion in addressing multi-party problems. Interest in collaborative processes in health promotion is rising, but still lacks monitoring instruments. The authors developed the DIagnosis of Sustainable Collaboration (DISC) model to enable comprehensive monitoring of public health collaboratives. The model focuses on opportunities and impediments for collaborative change, based on evidence from interorganizational collaboration, organizational behavior and planned organizational change. To illustrate and assess the DISC-model, the 2003/2004 application of the model to the Dutch whole-school health promotion collaboration is described. Methods. The study combined quantitative research, using a cross-sectional survey, with qualitative research using the personal interview methodology and document analysis. A DISC-based survey was sent to 55 stakeholders in whole-school health promotion in one Dutch region. The survey consisted of 22 scales with 3 to 8 items. Only scales with a reliability score of 0.60 were accepted. The analysis provided for comparisons between stakeholders from education, public service and public health. The survey was followed by approaching 14 stakeholders for a semi-structured DISC-based interview. As the interviews were timed after the survey, the interviews were used to clarify unexpected and unclear outcomes of the survey as well. Additionally, a DISC-based document analysis was conducted including minutes of meetings, project descriptions and correspondence with schools and municipalities. Results. Response of the survey was 77% and of the interviews 86%. Significant differences between respondents of different domains were found for the following scales: organizational characteristics scale, the change strategies, network development, project management, willingness to commit and innovative actions and adaptations. The interviews provided a more specific picture of the state of the art of the studied collaboration regarding the DISC-constructs. Conclusion. The DISC-model is more than just the sum of the different parameters provided in the literature on interorganizational collaboration, organization change, networking and setting-approaches. Monitoring a collaboration based on the DISC-model yields insight into windows of opportunity and current impediments for collaborative change. DISC-based monitoring is a promising strategy enabling project managers and social entrepreneurs to plan change management strategies systematically. © 2008 Leurs et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={It is easy to find in the research literature examples of information and communication technology for development (ICT4Dev) initiatives that have failed. Rather than continue with a focus on technologies, our journey has led us towards the establishment of a network of community-based, ICT-enabled, sustainable micro services enterprises (called Infopreneurs™) where "development through enterprise" is the key. The writers argue that such success requires a more socially responsible approach to business development. We have found that when the service delivery channel is enhanced by a coordinated approach to ownership and channel support, community-based businesses work well. On this journey, the challenge has been to deploy ICT in "production" mode, so that saleable products and services can be quickly delivered to the targeted community. On the basis of such learning, this article sets out a new paradigm for practitioners in this field. Here the term Infopreneurs™ is used to describe an ICT mediated network of "social entrepreneurs" who deliver sustainable and community level e-Business in Southern Africa. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Impact investing is an emerging alternative asset class. In the last few years, the investment in impact investing has grown many folds, however the research has not kept pace with the growing practitioner interest. The lack of knowledge about the field coupled with the lack of knowledge production of field might be dangerous in the long run. This is a systematic review of impact investing. This systematic review involves study of 85 published articles and reports. This literature was collected using the harzing’s publish or perish academic search engine and cross-checked against databases such as JSTOR and Web of Science. This review has four major contributions. First, the study reveals a unique longitudinal perspective on how the field is evolving and moving from pre-paradigm stage to the stage of proper scientific inquiry. It reveals that the field is evolving, as the reviewed literatures find that a higher number of empirical works were published recently. Second, the field impact investing is unique on six characteristics namely (1) capital invested, (2) degree of engagement with the investee, (3) process of selection, (4) social and commercial outcomes, (5) reporting outcomes, and (6) government role. Third, it reveals that the scholarship in the field has been mostly exploratory. Only recently the field is engaging in confirmatory studies. The research methods have used existing databases or existing single or multiple case studies. Finally, the field has to delve deeper into concepts like selection process, stakeholder management, opportunity recognition, and performance reporting to move the field forward and generate applied knowledge. © 2019 Journal of the Canadian Council for Small Business and Entrepreneurship/Conseil Canadien de la PME et de l’entrepreneuriat.},

abstract={Western theories on creativity emphasize the importance of access to resources and the generation of innovations as a source of sustainable competitive advantage for firms. However, perhaps the emphasis on slack resources and the firm as the level of analysis may be less appropriate for understanding the benefits of individual creative problem solving in resource-poor environments of the east; focusing solely on the firm is not sufficiently inclusive and may underestimate the benefits of creative problem solving under resource scarcity. Through an inductive interpretive case study of 12 problem solvers in the highly resource-poor environment of rural India, we identified the antecedents, dimensions and duality of outcomes for an Indian cultural source of creative problem solving called jugaad. Jugaad relies on assertive defiance, trial-and-error experiential learning and the recombination of available resources to improvise a frugal quick-fix solution. Our inductive framework provides new insights into the dual outcomes of creative problem solving from an eastern perspective; jugaad is unlikely to be a source of competitive advantage for firm growth but represents a source of enhanced wellbeing for inclusive growth. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies},

In response to a call to investigate the possibility of such differences, we analyse data from Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics II (PSED II) and find evidence to suggest that nascent entrepreneurs seeking to create for-profit social ventures have higher levels of entrepreneurial self-efficacy and more ambitious goals than their commercial counterparts.

abstract={Purpose - The growing prevalence of social entrepreneurship has been coupled with an increasing number of so-called "impact investors". However, much remains to be learned about this nascent class of investors. To address the dearth of scholarly attention to impact investing, this study seeks to answer four questions that are central to understanding the phenomenon. What are the defining characteristics of impact investing? Do impact investors differ from traditional classes of investors and, if so, how? What are the motivations that drive impact investment? And, what criteria do impact investors use when evaluating potential investments? Design/methodology/approach - A partially inductive study based on semi-structured interviews with 31 investors and ethnographic observation was conducted to explore how impact investors differ from other classes of investors in their motivations and unique criteria used to evaluate ventures seeking investment. Findings - This study reveals that impact investors represent a unique class of investors that differs from socially responsible investing, from other types of for-profit investors, such as venture capitalists and angel investors, and from traditional philanthropists. The varied motivations of impact investors and the criteria they use to evaluate investments are identified. Originality/value - Despite the growing practitioner and media attention to impact investing, several foundational issues remain unaddressed. This study takes the first steps toward shedding light on this new realm of early-stage venture investing and clarifying its role in larger efforts of social responsibility. © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Côté’s model of ‘identity capital’ is said to comprise a set of strengths and psycho-social skills that are deployed by individuals to both define themselves and represent how others define them. Identity capital is multi-dimensional by nature, both tangible and intangible in character and acquired through the application of resources in identity exchanges. The identity capital framework is built around the youth experience and is, therefore, germane to an exploration of the meaning, motivation and value of youth engagement with socially entrepreneurial endeavours. The young are described as an increasingly important cohort in terms of the creation of socially innovative solutions to the world’s ‘wicked problems’ – and as leaders, not merely followers. In this paper, the model is applied to a single case study of a young New Zealand social entrepreneur using multiple sources of both primary and secondary data (with a longitudinal orientation). Particular emphasis is given to probing how identity capital in this example is accumulated, deployed and exchanged in relation to the lived experience of being a young social entrepreneur, and through a socially entrepreneurial cultural frame of reference. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

The authors develop a survey instrument and analyse the determinants of the social entrepreneurial intentions of 236 individuals from China and the USA through factor analysis and structural equation modelling. They find that, when forming their social entrepreneurial intentions, those in China are influenced more by subjective norms and less by behavioural attitudes than those in the USA. The results thus suggest that the concept of social entrepreneurship is not uniform across the two cultures and that individuals are influenced by their culture when forming their social entrepreneurial intentions.},

Would existing NPOs, as opposed to new ones formed to embark on new social initiatives, strike out into a new territory, or engage in new ventures? What are the necessary internal organizational conditions? This study explores the direct effect of the organizational attributes on a NPO's intention to start a social enterprise. With a sample of 92 charities in Singapore, we found that NPOs led by CEOs with commercial experience, and NPOs possessing high collective efficacy and organization innovativeness were more likely to start a social enterprise. A NPO's social cause (mission) was also found to have a positive effect on its social entrepreneurship intention. Contrary to our expectations, resource availability and risk-taking propensity of the NPOs were not related to social entrepreneurship intentions. Findings and implications were discussed, and future research directions were provided. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={This paper describes how large youth populations in low- and middle-income countries, particularly those living in urban areas, are being demonized as potential threats to stability and development (the "youth bulge"). This negative perception is a self-fulfilling prophecy, as by neglecting or mistreating youth, they may become the very threats the proponents of the status quo fear most. In most of Africa, the majority are no longer in school, are unable to get jobs, often live in informal settlements and are out of touch with any organization at all. Meanwhile, national efforts to address their issues are confined to a ministry with minimal budget and influence. Usually, only small groups of the most educated, mainly male and older youth are reached, who are then hailed in international meetings as the creative resourceful leaders of tomorrow (or today). This paper argues that new, creative, holistic and youth-led programmes are needed to enable the majority of youth to participate as full citizens in the development of their communities and society as a whole. Young people need to have their own institutions at community level that provide a focus for their education, recreation and entrepreneurial activities, as well interaction with other organizations and involvement in and activism on issues that matter to them at local, national and international level. Such youth institutions should be supported by local as well as national governments, with sufficient funding and authority to ensure that youth are integrated and involved in all sectors. Africa's development depends on it. © 2011 International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED).},

abstract={Purpose: In view of significance of social entrepreneurial activity for community development, the purpose of this paper is to attempt to identify attributes of social entrepreneurs and philanthropists among returning successful diaspora in North Indian villages. Philanthropists are defined by the fact that they only invest money, whereas the social entrepreneurs invest their activities as well. An attempt is also made to ascertain key determinants and processes influencing outcomes of social entrepreneurial activity with a view to facilitate it. Design/methodology/approach: Emphasis is on qualitative analysis based on interviews of scientifically sampled respondents. However, the paper suggests that the rational choice approach is inappropriate to address the issue of community development. An approach based on a broader view of man in works of some classical economists like Adam Smith is more useful. Findings: The results of empirical analysis suggest that there exist substantial factors, such as early socialization, experience in community work, education and health, that differentiate social entrepreneurs and philanthropists. Salience of relationship between formal and informal institutions, personal traits and social skills of social entrepreneurs in influencing outcomes of social entrepreneurial activity is indicated. By investing moral and material resources in communities, social entrepreneurs augment social capital and facilitate social action. In contrast, philanthropists may add to distortions in community functioning, especially if they opt to operate through largely dysfunctional formal local institutions due to structural impasse in rural areas. Research limitations/implications: The paper pertains to Indian Punjab, an area with a long history of emigration. However, researchers need to take into account distinct socio-economic conditions in Punjab when designing studies for other areas. Practical implications: Policy measures addressing hurdles in the way of social entrepreneurial activity can speed up the modernization of traditional communities. Originality/value: The paper adds to understanding of what motivates human behaviour in economic analysis of community development. Further, it makes an important distinction between the roles of the philanthropist and the social entrepreneur in community development. The paper would be useful to researchers desirous of doing similar exercises in other areas. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

As the project has evolved over a decade, it has changed its development focus to reflect the changing context and various internal constraints. The study reveals that even though the project has had difficulties, its sheer survival and ability to adapt in a rapidly changing society have been important.

This article explores how social entrepreneurs integrate values into their de facto responsible innovations, and provides empirically informed strategies to develop, implement and scale these innovations. It is based on an empirical investigation of 42 case studies of best-practice social entrepreneurs. This empirical study shows that social entrepreneurs focus on creating direct socio-ethical value for their target beneficiaries. They coordinate collective stakeholder action to develop, implement and scale their systems-changing solutions. And their bottom-up innovations are evaluated and scaled for impact. Ultimately, institutional support is sought to create top-down systems change. This article suggests a synthesised model of integrated strategies for responsible innovation that also covers implementation and scaling of innovation. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

abstract={The ultimate mission of a social enterprise is to address the most pressing social or environmental issues in society. However, the majority of the social enterprises in the emerging context, such as Malaysia and Singapore, are confronted with struggles for survival and challenges of low performance leading to the issue of financial sustainability. Based on the resource-based view, this empirical study established a framework to assess the influence of the most prominent internal oriented resources (i.e., entrepreneurial orientation, social salience and business planning), which were moderated by socio-economic context, towards the financial and social performance of social enterprises. A quantitative survey method was applied in the collection of data, which were analysed using the Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modelling approach. A total of 181 Malaysian and Singaporean social enterprises were surveyed. The research findings reveal that the entrepreneurial orientation, in innovative, proactive and risk-taking terms, generates a substantial impact on financial performance, but no significant impact on the social outcome. The social salience of the enterprise founders was found to have a significant influence on their social achievement, but not on their financial achievement. The results challenge the conventional knowledge that assesses the performance of a hybrid entity such as a social enterprise through single or consolidated dimensions. Furthermore, Importance-Performance Map Analysis demonstrated a contrasting situation towards financial and social performance. Specifically, in achieving financial excellent, social enterprises should pay more attention to entrepreneurial orientation and reduce their social salience posture. However, to improve their social performance, they should concentrate on social salience and lower their entrepreneurial orientation. This, again, demonstrates the complexities and conflicting demands of hybrid organisations like social enterprises. Hence, in a highly favourable socio-economic context (i.e., Singapore), the negative impact of social salience on financial performance would become irrelevant. On the other hand, the positive influence of business planning towards social performance is more significant in a less favourable environment (i.e., Malaysia). These findings help social enterprise practitioners to determine their organisations’ strategic direction and offer a guiding model to social investors, policymakers and researchers. The results also improve our understanding of the mixed results occurring in previous literature and pledge opportunities for further research. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Entrepreneurship is often considered a male-gendered concept, and carries masculine connotations. However, the importance ofwomen entrepreneurs and their contribution to the economy has recently been realized. Nonetheless, there is limited research about female entrepreneurship and social entrepreneurship in the developing countries context. This paper challenges the implicit masculinism of the traditional entrepreneurship research, and aims to explore the enablers and constraints of female social entrepreneurship within the context of a developing country. Our theoretical focus is based on institutional and feminist perspectives, thus developing logic through reconciling predictions from these two competing theories. This integration contributes by offering novel insights about social entrepreneurship. Utilising an interpretive qualitative research approach, data from in-depth interviews with ten female social entrepreneurs of KP, Pakistan were analyzed using thematic analysis. Empirically, we identify and discuss a number of interesting and explanatory themes affecting female entrepreneurship such as "women empowerment, patriarchal culture, role of culture and societal norms, religious extremism and terrorism, forced entrepreneurs, change creators, unique institutional constraints, institutional corruption and security issues". The findings highlight female entrepreneurs' struggle for sustainability, and explain how this occurs. The paper also provides an interesting insight into how context determines social entrepreneurship in KP, Pakistan. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={Throughout the 20th century, urban gardening in central and northern Europe as well as in North America has received a great deal of academic attention. However, the recent proliferation of urban gardening in other geographies, such as southern Europe in the aftermath of the economic crisis of 2007–2008, remains underexplored. The economic crisis put on hold urban developments in many southern European cities, leaving idle plots of land waiting to be urbanized. The crisis also triggered radical political demands, such as those of the Indignados, as well as fuelling narratives revolving around social entrepreneurship and social innovation. Barcelona emerges as a laboratory of urban gardening initiatives in vacant lots mobilizing either radical urban demands or embedding new post-crisis rhetoric around social entrepreneurship. Through a combination of qualitative methods, including participant observation, a literature review, semi-structured interviews, informal conversations and field diaries, we present a characterization and evolution of the three most prominent urban gardening initiatives in the city of Barcelona (including 54 gardens at the end of 2016): the Network of Municipal Gardens (municipally led gardens for retired people); the Network of Communitarian Gardens (social movements); and the Empty Plots Plan (social entrepreneurial urban gardening). Subsequently, we discuss the different meanings of gardening in crisis/post-crisis Barcelona as well as the urban politics that each initiative articulates. Our results show that urban gardens within the city are an expression of different and non-exclusive meanings that explicitly or implicitly, in a context of crisis and post-crisis, mobilize notions of political gardening. © The Author(s) 2017.},

One important means for doing so is by adopting and promoting the recent B Corporation certification. Drawing on a comprehensive analysis of the emergence of this certification, we argue that when it comes to promoting their businesses, hybrid ventures should not adopt a one size fits all approach. Rather, their promotion strategies need to be adapted to their specific contexts. We theorize and develop a typology of certification promotion strategies for hybrid ventures based on the relative prevalence of other hybrid ventures in the same regions and industries. We conclude by articulating why the B Corporation movement is a rich and underexplored context for scholarship on hybrid ventures, and highlight several promising future research directions. © Copyright 2018 by Emerald Publishing Limited.},

We develop a framework that explains the effects of two cognitive structures - identity and power - on social entrepreneurs' perceptions of industry members and, in turn, the social entrepreneurs' rhetorical strategies for persuading the industry members to adopt new practices. Our framework specifies mechanisms through which social entrepreneurs facilitate systemic social change and, in doing so, informs theory at the intersection of social entrepreneurship, sustainable social change, and rhetoric. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.},

Design/methodology/approachPurposeful sampling was used to select 1kg.org as a single-case study. Semistructured in-depth interviews of three informants were conducted to obtain organization-specific insights. Interview data were analyzed following structuration theory. Secondary data and interviews of other social entrepreneurs and experts were used to support the findings. Research findings were validated using triangulation and member-checking methods. FindingsBecause of the institutional environment, most nonprofit organizations in China do not have resource independence and clear legal identity. Meanwhile, social enterprise has emerged as a new organizational form with the objective of creating social value through profitable business operations. Practical implicationsSocial enterprise is still in its infancy in China, particularly in the tourism field. This study reveals an innovative and sustainable model for nonprofit organizations in China facing institutional challenges and competitive funding environments. It provides recommendations to policymakers for improving mechanisms to increase social services through social enterprises.

abstract={This study explores the pathways from the aspiration to make a difference in the world to vision and action of social entrepreneurs. Based on the qualitative analysis of interviews with 23 individuals who have pioneered institutions and initiatives around corporate responsibility, we find two predominant pathways to vision. The deliberate path starts with aspiration and moves through purpose toward a relatively intentional vision that ultimately leads to, and is subsequently informed by, action. The emergent path also begins with aspiration then moves directly to action and only retrospectively to a sense of a vision behind the actions taken. The emergent path, in which action precedes vision, is contrary to the dominant assumption that vision leads to action in an entrepreneurial context and may be further characterized as either inadvertent or developmental. In advancing a conceptual model of the vision–action or action–vision trajectories of social entrepreneurs, this study highlights the iterative nature of vision. This study also demonstrates the importance of considering formative experiences that contribute to the aspiration to make some kind of a difference in the world, a sense of purpose or intentions, and core values and beliefs in examining the ethicality of social entrepreneurship. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Purpose: Using an integrated framework for performance management of nonprofit organizations, this paper aims to present an analysis of the activities of an Indigenous social enterprise in the town of Yirrkala in northeast Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory of Australia. The evaluation focuses on the social effectiveness of the organization and its ability to help generate income and employment and drive social capital creation. Design/methodology/approach: The analysis is informed by data derived from “yarns” with social enterprise staff and semi-structured interviews conducted with key informants who were selected using snowball sampling. Data were transcribed and analyzed thematically. Findings: The analysis reveals that the organization provides a successful community-based pathway for increasing Indigenous economic participation on local terms at a time of regional economic decline and high levels of Indigenous unemployment nationally. Practical implications: The measured effectiveness of Nuwul highlights the need for targeted policy support for Indigenous enterprises and that social entrepreneurship is far more likely to be successful in a supportive government policy environment, a critical need for government-initiated policies to encourage the formation of Indigenous social enterprises that are entrepreneurial and innovative in their solutions to poverty and marginalization. Such policies should not only aid the establishment of Indigenous ventures but also facilitate their long-term growth and sustainability. Originality/value: Although Indigenous entrepreneurial activities have been found to be effective in addressing Indigenous disadvantage in Australia, little is known about their community impact. The article provides original empirically grounded research on the measurement of Indigenous entrepreneurial activities and their wider community impact. The data show, against the backdrop of mixed results of government efforts to drive Indigenous economic mainstreaming, that the entrepreneurial activities analyzed in this paper are an example of more flexible and culturally appropriate pathways for achieving Indigenous equality in rural and remote regions of Australia. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Abstract: The increasing commercialization among non-profit organizations is shifting financial dependence from charitable donations to self-generated earned income through social entrepreneurial ventures. Little is known about the consequences of this shift. There is a lack of literature discussing how ventures into social entrepreneurship by non-profit organizations evolve and what effects they have on multiple dimensions of these organizations. To address this gap, the aim of this paper is to describe and analyse processes of commercialization of non-profit sector organizations and their effects on social-entrepreneurial NGOs in Cambodia. The data used in this study is based on a large-scale quantitative survey and qualitative key informant interviews with NGO leaders and administrators of NGOs in five regions across Cambodia. The authors found that the struggle for social and financial sustainability is one of the major motivations for organizations engaging in commercial ventures. Commercialization has transformative effects on the goals, motives, methods, income distribution, and governance component of NGOs in the sample. At the same time, however, commercialization tends to sideline the social mission of NGOs. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={The creation of social value through entrepreneurial ventures occurs in various dimensions, which are often difficult to compare. From an economic standpoint, however, value creation requires resources and activities that lead to expenditures. The sustainability of social ventures, therefore, depends on how these expenditures are financed. We develop a general framework in which business models of diverse social ventures can be analyzed and categorized. Using a gallery of real-life case studies, we illustrate that social business models can be characterized and ordered by the degree to which they monetize social value creation and the level of generated market revenues in excess of expenditures. Our analysis reveals a positive correlation between the monetization of social value creation and financial output, and it shows that relatively simple changes in the business model can have a significant impact on monetization and market performance. Our framework thus yields several strategic implications for business modeling.},

The emotion and power generated via these chains of interaction rituals (within and beyond the socially entrepreneurial Student Volunteer Army) had significant impact and positive outcomes that spilled over advantageously.

abstract={This contribution gives some reflections on the Netherlands' New Housing Memorandum 2000-2010, which was published on 15 May 2000. This Housing Memorandum urges the housing corporations (the social housing organisations which own 37 per cent of the housing stock) to sell 500 000 dwellings in 10 years. This seems to confirm Harloe's assertion that social housing in Europe is only a transitional tenure. Even in the Netherlands-champion of social rented housing within the European Union-the owner occupied sector would seem destined to marginalise the social rented sector in the long run. This paper argues that the housing corporations, being private, independent social entrepreneurs, will be only partially inclined to take the political message of the Housing Memorandum to heart. It is expected that the Dutch social rented sector will remain a differentiated sector and continue to blossom alongside home ownership. Harloe's theory will, in short, not be confirmed by the housing developments in the Netherlands.},

Despite growing research interests in social entrepreneurship, the field remains fragmented and this has led to calls for a careful examination of the implications of social entrepreneurship for firms. We draw on stakeholder theory and hybrid organizing to hypothesize that social performance mediates the SEO-financial performance relationship. By analyzing a sample of 1,156 companies, we find that the SEO-financial performance relationship is partially positively mediated by social performance even though the direct effect is negative. Our results show that social performance compensates for the otherwise negative effect SEO has directly with financial performance. We contribute to an understanding of the mechanisms by which an SEO affects firm performance and provide richer insights into the various aspects of performance. We discuss the future implications of our study and suggest promising avenues for further research on the SEO construct. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

Further, the authors collected data from 374 students from Mainland China and applied a regression analysis. Findings: The study clarifies the positive relationship between perceived university support and growth-oriented/independence-oriented entrepreneurial intentions. Further, it proposes the differences in the moderating role of the Chinese sense of face in the relationships between entrepreneurial self-efficacy and growth- and independence-oriented intentions. Research limitations/implications: Because of the chosen method, the study results may lack generalizability. Hence, future studies are encouraged to test the proposed hypotheses. Practical implications: The study results have important implications for entrepreneurship education development. Social implications: The study is conducted against the background of the “mass entrepreneurship and innovation” policy in China and combines country-specific characteristics to enrich entrepreneurial education and social entrepreneurship.

abstract={Balancing social and economic missions in the pursuit of growth is one of the greatest challenges faced by social ventures. Although social ventures strive for growth to scale their social impact, pursuing growth often results in mission drift and the sacrifice of social objectives, which in turn eventually undermine the ventures’ raison d’être. In this study, we investigate how and with what outcomes social ventures that pursue growth can manage the balance of social and economic missions. Through a comparative case study of six for-profit social ventures, we find significant differences in how dual missions are selected, connected, and intertwined, leading to varying degrees of mission spillover effects between social and economic missions. Our findings show that two-sided mission spillover effects are a central mechanism in dual mission management, enabling social ventures to pursue balanced growth, avoid mission drift, and achieve social impact. With these findings, this study adds to the emergent literature on social entrepreneurship, dual mission management, and social venture growth. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

An inductive theory-building approach was adopted to explore this and advance current knowledge in the boundaries of social entrepreneurship and policy. We propose ‘Engagement’ and ‘Disengagement’ as the two strategies used by social enterprises in this context in accessing government support and policy. ‘Engagement’ is a strategy comprising of the tactics: (a) Leveraging Policy, (b) Building and Leveraging Relationships, (c) Lobbying, and (d) Monitoring. ‘Disengagement’ is a strategy comprising of the tactics: (a) Avoiding Government Presence, and (b) Disengagement from Policy. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

However, with 17 SDGs and no less than 169 associated targets, understanding how social enterprises can contribute to the achievement of these goals remains challenging, particularly given the diversity of social enterprise models that exist globally. This chapter contributes toward addressing this problem by introducing a framework for conceptualising how social enterprises can contribute to the SDGs, illustrated with global examples. The chapter begins by reviewing what has been written about social enterprises and the SDGs. This is followed by the development and presentation of the conceptual framework. Finally, conclusions and areas for future research on social enterprises and the SDGs are identified. © 2018 by Emerald Publishing Limited. All rights reserved.},

It does so by analysing the resources the EU provided to promote social innovation over the period 2006–2014. Three main conclusions arise. First, between 2006 and 2010 the label social innovation was rarely used, although several EU instruments and processes supported it. Second, throughout 2009–2010, the European Commission’s Bureau of European Policy Advisers played a key agenda setting role in flagging social innovation on the eve of the Europe 2020 Strategy. Consequently, and third, since 2010 social innovation has been explicitly mainstreamed into the EUs new growth strategy. This phase is characterized by a stronger emphasis on “social entrepreneurship” and “social experimentation”. As a result, social innovation has become an important tool in the European Semester’s focus on the reform of the welfare state. © 2017 “The European Association for the Advancement of the Social Sciences” (EA) Foundation.},

abstract={The rapid rise of alternative organisations such as social enterprises is largely due to the promotional activities of intermediary organisations. So far, little is known about the affective nature of such activities. The present article thus investigates how intermediary organisations make social entrepreneurship palatable for a broader audience by establishing it as an object of desire. Drawing on affect-oriented extensions of Laclau and Mouffe’s poststructuralist theory, hegemonisation is suggested as a way of understanding how social entrepreneurship is articulated through a complementary process of signification and affective investment. Specifically, by examining Austrian intermediaries, we show how social entrepreneurship is endowed with a sense of affective thrust that is based on three interlocking dynamics: the articulation of fantasies such as ‘inclusive exclusiveness’, ‘large-scale social change’ and ‘pragmatic solutions’; the repression of anxiety-provoking and contentious issues (constitutive quiescences); as well as the use of conceptually vague, floating signifiers (moments of indeterminacy). Demonstrating that the hegemonisation of social entrepreneurship involves articulating certain issues whilst, at the same time, omitting others, or rendering them elusive, the article invites a counter-hegemonic critique of social entrepreneurship, and, on a more general level, of alternative forms of organising, that embraces affect as a driving force of change, while simultaneously affirming the impossibility of harmony and wholeness. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.},

It also creates rich opportunities for social entrepreneurs, gives investors more socially responsible options, and offers a helpful designation for consumers.

The framework profiles NMPs according to their propensity to engage firms; it also classifies firms based on their vulnerability and initial reaction to NMP attacks. Corroborated with a mathematical model (detailed in the appendix), the conceptual framework explains why and which NMPs are most hostile to firms, why some NMPs issue threats while others strike out at commercial firms quickly and without warning, and which firms are most vulnerable to such hostility. © Academy of Management Perspectives.},

Of Hofstede's () cultural dimensions, power distance is negatively related to all types of entrepreneurship, and Inglehart's () secular-rational values are positively related to established entrepreneurship. Self-expressive values relate positively with established social entrepreneurship. The results imply that the existence of social problems and/or market failures does not result in higher levels of social entrepreneurship unless the formal institutions are sufficiently developed.

abstract={In much of southern Africa, ecotourism has been widely acknowledged as critical for enhancing livelihoods of communities living outside protected areas. Several studies highlight the potential of tourism as a mechanism for driving rural economies in Africa. Using the case of the Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park shared among Zimbabwe, South Africa, and Mozambique, this paper demonstrates how communities are engaging in ecotourism entrepreneurship. A decade after the emergence of transfrontier parks in the region, no studies have explored how new and vibrant assemblages of individuals and community actors tap the potential of ecotourism. This study is based on 57 semi-structured interviews with participants drawn from four wards in southeast Zimbabwe. In addition, a netnography (online ethnography) of a Facebook page administered by a local community trust promoting ecotourism was undertaken. Findings demonstrate that innovative community leaders imagine, embrace, and exploit ecotourism opportunities that arise from their proximity to transfrontier parks. More specifically, this study characterises these entrepreneurs, their local and extra-local connections, how they actively engage in social networking to promote cultural tourism and development of a visible ecotourism product. This paper contributes to the understudied aspect of social entrepreneurship in ecotourism planning within transfrontier conservation areas. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to investigate the capabilities of social entrepreneurship (SE) firms and how they achieve competitive advantage while engaging in social value creation. The authors employ a business model perspective to understand the (self-) sustaining mechanism for social good. Design/methodology/approach – The authors carry out an in-depth investigation of three SE ventures. The authors analyse the history of these ventures to determine how they achieved competitive advantage. The cases are analysed based on the internal development in the context of environmental support. Findings – The authors find that SE ventures, like all other organisations, achieve competitive advantage based on available resources such as reputation and network of the founder, managerial experience and other corporate resources within the firm. The authors also find that the competitive advantage often comes from innovate usage – a practice that is reinforced by the support from institutional environment. Research limitations/implications – Due to the case study approach, the research is aimed at theoretical development within the social business literature. The approach makes it difficult for the findings to be universally generalisable. The authors therefore envisage future researchers to test the theoretical propositions. Practical implications – Based on the analysis, the authors conclude that distinct capabilities of social businesses help them achieve competitive advantage, and that policy makers should institutionally support these ventures. The findings stress the importance of resources in sustainability and effectiveness of emerging market SE. Originality/value – The application of a business model perspective in SE is unique, and advances the understanding of social businesses from a strategic management perspective. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={This article develops a Hayekian perspective on social franchising that distinguishes between the end-connected logic of the small group and the rule-connected logic of the big group. Our key claim is that mission-driven social entrepreneurs often draw on the small-group logic when starting their social ventures and then face difficulties when the process of scaling shifts their operations toward a big-group logic. In this situation, social franchising offers a strategy to replicate the small group despite systemwide scaling, to mobilize decentrally accessible social capital, and to reduce agency costs through mechanisms of self-selection and self-monitoring. By employing a Hayekian perspective, we are thus able to offer an explanation as to why social franchising is a suitable scaling strategy for some social entrepreneurship organizations and not for others. We illustrate our work using the Ashoka Fellow Wellcome. © The Author(s) 2012.},

abstract={This article adds to the ongoing debate on the relationship between poverty reduction, profits, and environmental sustainability. Drawing from the literature, it presents a conceptual model with propositions to explain how social entrepreneurs can lead to sustainable development in developing countries. These propositions are further strengthened by using a descriptive case of Waste Concern-an initiative of social entrepreneurs-in Bangladesh. Findings illustrate that, despite contextual constraints in developing countries, it is possible to have sustainable development with no trade-off between poverty reduction and environmental sustainability. This win-win outcome is possible through the innovative approaches and creative thinking of social entrepreneurs who, rather than being hindered by contextual constraints, act as catalysts for sustainable development. The findings have implications for academics and policy-makers, highlighting the significance of supporting social entrepreneurs to come up with innovative methods for sustainable development. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={This paper analyzes how social venture capitalists evaluate the integrity of social entrepreneurs. Based on an experiment with 40 social venture capitalists and 40 students, we investigate how five attributes of the entrepreneur contribute to the assessment of integrity. These attributes are the entrepreneur's personal experience, professional background, voluntary accountability efforts, reputation and awards/fellowships granted to the entrepreneur. Results indicate that social venture capitalists focus largely on voluntary accountability efforts of the entrepreneur and the entrepreneur's reputation when judging integrity. For an overall positive judgment of integrity, it seems to be sufficient if either voluntary accountability efforts or reputation of the entrepreneur are high. By comparing social venture capitalists with students, we show that experience leads to a simpler decision model focusing on key attributes. © 2012 International Society for Third-Sector Research and The John's Hopkins University.},

I maintain that this emerging form of entrepreneurship is usually inherent in the management of sports, which transforms sport-based organisations into an entrepreneur and enterprise. This paper draws on interdisciplinary approaches from the entrepreneurship and sport management literature to discuss the social entrepreneurship inherent within sports-based organisations. The sport sector provides an exploration of the contextual boundaries of social entrepreneurship and provides a useful discussion on the innovation, risk taking and proactive activity. The implications for sport organisations involved in social entrepreneurship are stated and the importance of governments around the world to promote social entrepreneurship in sport are highlighted. In addition, suggestions for future research are stated that highlight the role of sport-based entrepreneurship theory for examining social change. Copyright © 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={The phenomenon of media entrepreneurship is currently attracting increasing interest by scholars and practitioners alike. However, most of this attention is devoted to entrepreneurship within new media, while some of the traditional media industries—for example print media—are believed to be the living dead without much future promise. Nonetheless, sustainable entrepreneurial ventures do emerge in these traditional media industries. These ventures demonstrate that new venture creation and survival in traditional media industries is in fact possible and that the current scholarly focus on new media entrepreneurial activities is too restrictive. This article conceptualizes and explores the phenomenon of entrepreneurship in traditional media industries. Empirically, it is based on the Swedish case of the company Latifeh, its magazine Gringo, and their further (media) activities. Gringo and the team behind it have received massive media attention as well as several prizes for their innovativeness, and stirred up the emotions of many people. A number of propositions are derived from the case, which can serve as a starting point of future empirical work on media entrepreneurship in traditional industries. In addition, these propositions can serve as practical guiding lights for (potential) media entrepreneurs. © 2008 Journal of Media Business Studies.},

abstract={This paper defines and analyses incubators that mainly support start-ups with a significant social impact. In 2016, a survey was conducted on the 162 incubators active in Italy, and a total of 88 responses were received. An analysis of the literature and of this dataset led to the identification of three types of incubators: Business, Mixed, and Social. Thirty of the respondents sent information on their tenants. Thanks to the data regarding 247 tenants, it was possible to analyze the impact of the three different types of incubators (Business, Mixed, and Social) on the tenants’ growth through OLS regression analyses. A Social Incubator is here defined as an incubator that supports more than 50% of start-ups that aim to introduce a positive social impact. The study shows that Social Incubators perceive social impact measurement and training/consulting on business ethics and CSR as being more important services than other incubator types. The regression analyses explain that Social Incubators are as efficient as other incubators, in terms of tenants’ economic growth, notwithstanding the focus of Social Incubators on start-ups that do not pursue only economic objectives. Finally, this study indicates that policymakers can foster Social Incubators to support social entrepreneurship. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={In recent years, the study of women entrepreneurship has experienced great growth, gaining a broad consensus among academics and contributing above all to understanding all those factors that explain the difficulty of women in undertaking an entrepreneurial career. This document tries to contribute to the field of study, thanks to a systematic analysis through the publications present in the topic. For this purpose, 2,848 peer-reviewed articles were analyzed, published between 1950 and 2019, using the Scopus database (SCImago Research Group). Through the use of a series of bibliometric indicators it was possible to define the current state of research on the international scene. The analysis revealed that it is a multidisciplinary field of study and that has started to expand further since 2006, culminating in 2019, which makes it become a current and valid object of study. The analysis of the clusters allowed to isolate 6 different lines of research in which emerged, on the one hand, the importance of entrepreneurial education, social entrepreneurship and the socio-cultural context of reference (e.g., culture, family, and institutional support) as tools to overcome the gender gap, on the other, the importance that women entrepreneurship assumes in the economic growth of the country (especially in developing economies), promoting social inclusion and combating poverty and discrimination. The study presents an important contribution to reflect on current policies and to outline future lines of investigation. © Copyright © 2020 Cardella, Hernández-Sánchez and Sánchez-García.},

This research empirically studies 303 social enterprises in Saudi Arabia and develops three hypotheses that examine the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation (EO) and social entrepreneurs’ firm performance. The results show that innovativeness and proactiveness, but not risk-taking, are positively associated with firm performance. Thus, whilst SEs cover a wide range of business activities there is generally a positive effect of EO across the contexts investigated. Also, this research found that EO can be used as a mechanism to overcome constraints imposed by limited resources in an environment where new opportunities rarely occur. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

The applicability and implications of the framework are examined through a case study of a social restaurant (Mageires). Data collected from various restaurant stakeholders (customers, employees, suppliers, owners/founders, and other business partners) identified three market capabilities for generating social value and change: network structure (building networks with various stakeholders), market practices (e.g. institutionalization of “new currencies” for conducting economic transactions, adoption of ethical, flexible, and all inclusive recruiting practices), and market pictures (e.g. use of a common terminology and performance metrics and generation of stakeholders’ dialogues for creating intersubjective meanings). © The Author(s) 2018.},

abstract={Regardless of the crucial role of civil society in social innovation, European Union (EU) social innovation concepts emphasized market-economic features rather than social by prioritizing social business over social movements. By emphasizing the economic features of social innovation, social enterprises, as ventures with both social and economic goals, are frequently associated with social innovation, especially in the developed economies. As an EU member country, Slovenia needed to adjust its policies to the EU social innovation concepts. Bearing in mind the EU interpretation of social innovation and the significance of state policies for its development, our aim is to investigate the policy framework conditions for the development of forestry-based social innovation initiatives in Slovenia. We found out that the prevalent economic understanding of social innovation reflects in Slovenian policy documents by equating social innovation with social enterprise. In this sense, the view of social innovation as both growth engine and a way for solving societal problems translates into explicit statements on social innovation in cohesion policy documents and progresses by operationalization of social innovation through indicators solely on social enterprise. Within the regulatory framework on social entrepreneurship, social enterprise is defined strictly with respect to legal forms, activities, profit sharing and governance, imposing barriers to the registration and development. Similarly to cohesion policy, the Rural Development Programme embraces a market-oriented understanding of social innovation and focuses explicitly on social enterprise. Forest policy documents do not explicitly mention social innovation or social enterprise. This is reasonable for documents adopted before 2011 when social innovation and social enterprises became a part of the prevailing discourse in Slovenia. However, newly adopted forest policy documents also do not integrate either social innovation or social enterprise. As forestry-based social innovation initiatives cannot be officially recognized as such, there are two possible ways for them to develop. The first applies to market-oriented, forestry-based social innovation initiatives that offer new products or services. Such initiatives can register as social enterprises and mobilize resources they can access within the social entrepreneurship regulatory framework and the Rural Development Programme measures explicitly addressing social enterprise. The second way addresses forestry-based social innovation initiatives that are not market-oriented. Those initiatives will have to navigate through policy framework conditions for resources available through the Rural Development Programme and forest policy instruments that target cooperation and networking. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to establish a conceptual link between the research domains of social entrepreneurship and servant leadership by exploring the proposition that social entrepreneurs may have specific leadership attributes that allow classifying them as servant leaders. Design/methodology/approach: Five servant leadership attributes were identified based on the literature review: altruism, humility, integrity, trust in others and empathy. In an exploratory study, these attributes were examined in a sample of 78 Russian entrepreneurs. Findings: Survey results indicate that social entrepreneurs indeed differ from traditional ones in four of the perceived servant leadership attributes: altruism, integrity, trust in others and empathy. However, no differences in humility between social and traditional entrepreneurs were found. Research limitations/implications: The limitations of this study are the sample size and the sampling technique used (targeted and snowball sampling). Another limitation is the nature of the instrument used: servant leadership attributes were measured through a self-assessment questionnaire, making it susceptible to a social desirability bias. The study contributes toward setting a future research agenda for the further studies of both social entrepreneurship and servant leadership. Originality/value: This paper introduces a conceptual connection between social entrepreneurship and servant leadership.

A distinction between two types of SE activity is introduced: compensatory and transformative. Compensatory SE compensates for market failures within the global capitalist system. By contrast, transformative SE specifically seeks to change the system of global capitalism. Using the examples of the alter-globalization movement and transition towns, the paper advances a conceptualization of transformative SE which contrasts assumptions with compensatory SE. This distinction aids to make the field of SE more truly global, multidisciplinary, representative and emancipatory. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Often, their actions catalyse whole new forms of economic and social activity. Such entrepreneurship is not restricted to the marketplace. Over recent decades, social scientists have studied the practices of actors in and around government who have been described, among other things, as policy entrepreneurs or institutional entrepreneurs. Attention has also been given to social entrepreneurs, who use knowledge of business practices to advance solutions to major social problems. We consider here how policy entrepreneurs engage in collaborative action to promote broad societal changes, focusing on pursuit of the United Nations' sustainable development goals (SDGs).

Two stages of statistical analysis were performed based on the process and content theories of motivation. We used structural equation modelling to validate the model and paired samples t-test analysis to examine the differences between the motives underlying social entrepreneurship intentions. Findings: 202 out of 364 students reported social entrepreneurial intentions. For the process-based motives, perceived feasibility and perceived desirability to start a social enterprise as well as exposure to entrepreneurship are significant predictors of stu-dents’ intention to form a social enterprise. In addition, perceived feasibility is determined by entrepreneurship education and entrepreneurial self-efficacy, and perceived desirability is determined by students’ desire for self-realisation and autonomy. For the content-based motives, the principal-component analysis indicates that students are motivated by the need for achievement and independence. Implications & Recommendations: The findings provide insights into the formation of social entrepreneurial intentions as well practical implications for how to motivate future social entrepreneurs. Contribution & Value Added: The study empirically shows the motives influencing a student’s intent to form a social enterprise. © 2018, Cracow University of Economics. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The aim of this study was to map and analyse the scenario of scientific production with respect to social innovation through a bibliometric study, using the Scopus database, contributing to future studies on this topic. We identified the main themes addressed in the field and the main authors, works and citations, in addition to analysing a co-citation map and determining whether the term 'social innovation' depends on the field of innovation. The results show that the most commonly cited key words are 'innovation' and 'social entrepreneurism', demonstrating their complementarity. The number of citations has grown in recent years, demonstrating an opportunity to conduct academic studies in the field and an opportunity to conduct quantitative studies, given that the articles examined in this study were theoretical and qualitative in nature. Apparently, innovation is not the main field in which this theme is analysed; rather, institutional theory, social entrepreneurship and public policy constitute the main theoretical framework found in this work.

abstract={Social enterprises are the products of the social, cultural, commercial, and political expectations of the innovation's range of stakeholders, not solely the vision of the social entrepreneur(s). The power of stakeholders to influence the development of an innovation is drawn from their salience and the resources, access, and/or legitimacy that their support would provide. In this way, the actions of social entrepreneurs represent the interests of communities and it is through processes of resistance, negotiation, and collaboration that the actions of social enterprises become the manifestations of collective social processes. This paper draws on the development of a nascent social enterprise in New Zealand to demonstrate how the effects of its context ultimately shaped its innovative business model. Using an ethnographic methodology, the development of the business model and the partnership through which it formed was examined by the author as a central actor as it unfolded. The case study serves as an illustrative example of the ways in which differing expectations, beliefs, and logics of stakeholders induces particular decisions to be made about the design, resourcing, and strategy of the venture. © 2016 by De Gruyter.},

Two social entrepreneur cases demonstrate a mutually beneficial situation of lowering the structural unemployment rate, returning young human capital to villages and innovating rural tourism through the activism of service science. Design/methodology/approachQualitative approach was applied to data obtained from 12 research projects spanning three years. Service experience engineering (SEE) methods were used to conduct a service design for social entrepreneurs in an integrated service system. The service system aimed to innovate rural tourism through the activism of service science. FindingsSEE methods explain a series of service design processes that helped our research team start up two social entrepreneur projects as service prototypes to offer service innovation based on cultural creativity to innovate rural tourism. These two social entrepreneurs in rural tourism offer job opportunities to young people and senior citizens alike. In addition, an integrated service system of interdisciplinary knowledge, multi-stakeholders and local resources fulfills various requirements of stakeholders to promote sustainable rural tourism. Research limitations/implicationsReal action studies are limited in the research on social entrepreneurs. This case study provides research insights into service science and calls for action in practice to change the future of a local village. The results provide the philosophy and knowledge of service science that social entrepreneurs of rural tourism can use in the village.

Mechanisms that enable the alignment of these seemingly contradicting goals are necessary.

This mechanism allows customers to determine the price they are willing and able to pay. The authors explain that this mechanism enables social ventures to generate social value through their commercial activities by serving more beneficiaries in need, reducing the stigma of receiving help, allowing non-disadvantaged customers to show support for the social venture, and aligning commercial activities with the social mission, all while ensuring that sufficient economic value is captured to sustain operations. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Purpose - Despite the increase in empirical studies of social enterprise in management and organization research, the lack of a cohesive knowledge base in this area is concerning. In this chapter, we propose that the underdevelopment of the attendant research infrastructure is an important, but oft-overlooked, barrier to the development of this body of empirical research. Design/methodology - We explore this proposition through a review of 55 empirical studies of social enterprises published in the last fifteen years, in which we examine the mix and trajectory of research methods used and the research infrastructure on which these studies depend. Findings - We find that empirical research has used social enterprise largely as a context for theory development, rather than deductively testing, and thus building upon, existing theories. The latter pattern is due largely to the absence of two key dimensions of infrastructure: welldefined samples, and consistent, operational measures of social enterprise success. Finally, we identify present trends along both dimensions that contribute to changing the research infrastructure for empirical social enterprise research. Originality/value - Our analysis highlights the critical need for research infrastructure to advance empirical research on social enterprise. From this perspective, research infrastructure-building provides an important opportunity for researchers interested in social enterprise and others interested in enabling high-quality empirical research in this setting. © 2014 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

My focus on the Argentine program will serve two interrelated purposes. First, it helps us to better understand the production of a particular kind of neoliberal subject, the social entrepreneur who functions as the engine for change. Second, the study engages in questions about the transferability of models in socially, politically, and pedagogically diverse contexts, through what I call policy microlending, of teacher education and of particular artifacts within it to organizations that channel discourses about change coming from the grassroots. © 2014 by the Comparative and International Education Society.

abstract={Purpose: This paper aims to build theory on the resource mobilisation process of nascent community ventures (CVs). CVs are a type of social enterprises set up with the aim of creating social wealth within the communities in which they reside. Guided by resource dependence theory, the paper analyses how CVs introduce new ideas and activities into conservative communities. In particular, the paper explores how emerging CVs mobilise resources from local communities and how the resource mobilisation process shapes these new ventures. Design/methodology/approach: Longitudinal case studies were conducted on the emergence of two music festivals in rural communities in Norway. Findings: In the early stages of the venture formation process, the nascent CVs had an asymmetric dependence relationship with local resource providers because they lacked legitimacy and resources. The CVs were seeking to introduce new activities, and they simultaneously implemented two strategies to access resources: they adapted to and altered their environment. Throughout the resource mobilisation process, the CVs developed a joint dependence relationship with local resource providers. In later stages of the process, the CVs implemented strategies to increase their embeddedness and engage greater portions of the local communities in the ventures. Originality/value: The paper's longitudinal approach to the resource mobilisation process made it possible to reveal how entrepreneurs and local resource providers interact over time to create new CVs. Building on resource dependence theory, the paper provides an explanation for how CVs are able to become embedded in their local communities while introducing new ideas that depart from existing practices. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to show that not only (obviously) social enterprises but also conventional ones are based on social intentions and that these social intentions often have community dimensions. The conclusion of these findings is that conventional research, and consequently, also the public debate on entrepreneurship as well as on social and community entrepreneurship, is guided by false notions rather than on empirical facts. Design/methodology/approach: The paper starts by presenting the dominating references on entrepreneurship, social entrepreneurship and community entrepreneurship and then goes on to compare them. The existence of social motives among conventional enterprises is brought to the fore, first through a presentation of the official statistics of the motives for all new starters in Sweden and then with a presentation of cases from different sectors. The cases selected to represent the starters have all expressed social motives for going into business. "Care" was the word used by the individuals themselves and therefore the care concept is introduced. Findings: Social intentions can be found in conventional market enterprises. The intentions of the entrepreneurs' are often expressed in terms of "care". Care for the community is often an important part of other care dimensions. Research limitations/implications: The empirical findings of care in conventional market enterprises and care for the community as an important care dimension in the cases presented have implications not only for theories on conventional, social and community entrepreneurship but also for theory building in social sciences in general. The dominance of English-speaking researchers can be a problem from this perspective. Practical implications: Both the descriptions and the analysis have practical implications for everyone interested in entrepreneurship and the circumstances for enterprises of all kinds as well as for local and regional development. Originality/value: The paper questions what is taken-for-granted, with the help of empirical examples and not just with statements. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={This article examines the co-evolution of interactive technology and non-governmental organizations in Eastern Europe. It addresses, on the one side, the emergence of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) as actors who exhibit new organizational topographies and, on the other side, the emergence of the Internet and related interactive technologies that not only provide a new medium of representation in a virtual public sphere but also make possible fundamental changes in the character of organization. We explore how organizations of civil society can be a source of organizational and technological innovation necessary for their societies' ongoing adaptability in a rapidly changing global economy. As such, NGOs can use new technologies within and beyond their existing roles as safety nets (to mitigate the new social problems of emerging market economies) and as safety valves (to give voice to social groups underrepresented in the newly competitive polities) to function as social entrepreneurs exploring new organizational forms as ongoing sources of innovation.},

abstract={This study endorses the use of data envelopment analysis, which uses benefit-of-the-doubt weighting to evaluate the social, economic and overall performance of social enterprises. This methodology is especially useful for creating composite indicators based on multiple outputs expressed in different measurement units, and allows for enterprise-specific weighting of the different objectives. Applying this methodology on a unique longitudinal dataset of Flemish sheltered workshops suggests that social enterprises may face different types of mission drift. Further, our results show that top-performing social enterprises are more economically and socially efficient than low performers. These top performers also have a stronger economic orientation, which sheds new light on the balance between social and economic orientations in social enterprises. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={Purpose: Social entrepreneurship has become a growing field of research interest. Yet, past research has been held back by the lack of a rigorous measurement instrument. Rather than defining social entrepreneurship as an organizational form that a venture does or does not have, this paper agrees with Dees and Anderson (2006) that the construct is better thought of as a set of practices, processes and behaviors that organizations can engage in to a higher or a lesser degree. In other words, the construct is a set of behaviors that any organization can engage in. The purpose of the paper is to develop scale items to measure the construct of organizational social entrepreneurship (OSE). Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on previous literature, this paper first develops and then validates scales for measuring OSE as a third-order formative construct. As its second order, the scale includes three components that capture the heterogeneity of the OSE concept: social change intention, commercial activity and inclusive governance. Findings: The OSE scale is developed and tested through a sample of 182 nascent social enterprises from 55 different countries in the world and then revalidated using a second sample of 263 mature social enterprises from 6 European countries. Results suggest that the scale items exhibit internal consistency, reliability, construct validity and nomological validity. Research limitations/implications: The scale presented here offers an important new venue for social entrepreneurship theorizing. First, it allows scholars to take a broad approach toward a diverse field and to study OSE behavior in any empirical field in which it may occur. Second, the scales also allow for more focused theorizing. Scholars are encouraged to delve into the antecedents of all three components presented here and to study the different performance effects they have in terms of likelihood to survive, growth rate or potential to achieve financial sustainability. Originality/value: The paper develops a multidimensional construct for OSE. In particular, the authors propose scale items for three central components of social entrepreneurship, namely, social change intentions, commercial activities and inclusive governance. The scales thus measure the three formative dimensions identified by Dees and Anderson (2006) and Defourny and Nyssens (2010). © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Promoting green socioentrepreneurship is crucial for sustainable economic development in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in highly urbanised areas such as Taiwan and Hong Kong. However, little research has focused on this topic. Therefore, we conducted two studies to analyse how personality traits, entrepreneurial creativity, and social capital affect green socioentrepreneurial intentions among university students in Taiwan and Hong Kong. The results of Study 1 confirmed the factor structures of the four scales used in this study. The results of Study 2 revealed that though the effects of predictor variables on the outcome variable were varied, the mediation models of entrepreneurial creativity across contexts were partially supported. The major differences between Taiwan and Hong Kong lay in the effects resulting from usefulness, openness, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and bonding social capital. © 2017, © 2017 Society for Research into Higher Education.},

abstract={Social enterprises (SEs) primarily aim to create social value, that is, to generate benefits or reduce costs for society, while maintaining financial sustainability. Owing to their unique operating conditions and organizational characteristics, SEs face more severe resource challenges than their commercial counterparts. These challenges are exacerbated for SEs operating in emerging economies with complex social contexts. Overcoming these resource constraints and social challenges is vital for SEs to achieve their mission. Using an inductive multiple case-study approach, we identify a unique bricolage solution for achieving the dual objectives of SEs. Our findings suggest that identifying locally embedded village level entrepreneurs is a bricolage activity that social entrepreneurs leverage in the resource constrained environment of emerging economies, especially for the social enterprises that are active in the villages but were founded by social entrepreneurs who are not from these villages. This article therefore contributes to both social entrepreneurship literature as well as entrepreneurial bricolage literature and has important implications for future research and practice. © 2019 The International Association for Chinese Management Research.},

Our multilevel analysis across 11 welfare states shows that social enterprises are perceived as a more efficient solution to social problems when a liberal or socialist logic dominates a given state's market coordination and social welfare provision.

abstract={The article seeks to further our understanding of the process of organizing nascent social ventures. It builds upon current research on the political and collaborative nature of the social entrepreneurial process, and takes an ANT-inspired processual approach to follow the organizational practices carried by a nascent social venture in its efforts to mobilize stakeholders, bring about collaboration and ultimately secure resources. It draws upon empirical material generated during the first year of a social venture I founded and continue to chair. Findings highlight the adaptive and fluid nature of the organizational practices involved in nascent organizations and indicate that the capacity to continuously adjust the qualities of the eventual venture to the stakes of potential partners is instrumental to start up the venture. The article suggests the notion of tinkering to underscore the fluidity, the ongoing and piecemeal everyday work of such organizing processes. Further, findings highlight the extent to which social ventures, as well as the engaged scholar, are caught in the networks that contribute to reproduce the social problem they aim to change. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.},

abstract={Policy designers seeking to harness profit-driven efficiency for public purposes are increasingly creating organizations with fractionalized property rights that distribute "ownership" among public and private actors. The resulting hybrids are quite diverse, including mixed enterprises, public-private partnerships, social entrepreneurship organizations, government-sponsored enterprises, and various other hybrid forms. Marrying public purposes to private sector efficiency and strategic flexibility provides a tempting rationale for mixing public and private owners in hybrid organizations. Because public-private hybrids involve fractionalized property rights, however, they exhibit tension among owners over both strategy and, more importantly, goals. To understand public-private hybrids, we assess them in terms of six dimensions of property rights: fragmentation of ownership, clarity of allocation, cost of alienation, security from trespass, credibility of persistence, and autonomy (of both owners and managers). The unclear allocation of fractionalized ownership rights facilitates the appropriation of financial residuals and asset ownership opportunistically. Other weaknesses in the property rights configurations of public-private hybrids create managerial dissonance or opportunistic behavior that typically leads to a narrowing of goals, but sometimes also to organizational failure. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to identify social entrepreneurship dimensions that emphasize the specific personal characteristics of social entrepreneurs (SPCSE) and social entrepreneurship organization (SEO) among students in higher education institutions who are active participants of the Students in Free Enterprise (SIFE) program in Malaysia.
Design/methodology/approach: Quantitative approaches and instruments were used to analyze the profile of social entrepreneurship in this cross-sectional survey study, which involved 394 active SIFE students in Malaysia in 2011. The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) was used to analyze the data and describe the SIFE student’s SPCSE and SEO.
Findings: The social entrepreneurship of the SIFE students was high, with a dominant SEO. However, the dimensions of SPCSE need to be applied effectively to the students involved, whose social entrepreneurship was merely moderate. There was a strong positive relationship between SPCSE and SEO of SIFE students, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.73.
Research limitations/implications: It is recommended that further longitudinal research be conducted to assess the depth of the impact of social entrepreneurship on SIFE students. In this manner, more useful information related to the impact can be leveraged to improve the pattern of the social entrepreneurship program.
Practical implications: The SIFE participants’ social entrepreneurship profile can be used by the Ministry of Higher Education in formulating social entrepreneurship policy for higher education institutions. The Malaysia SIFE Foundation and the administrators of higher education institutions should encourage more university students to participate in SIFE program to increase the number of social entrepreneurs who will help solve social, economic, and environmental problems.
Originality/value: There has been no discussions of the social entrepreneurship programs in Malaysia. This paper attempts to fill the current gap. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Design/methodology/approach: After reviewing the literature on strategic social change initiatives the authors briefly describe two such initiatives: corporate social responsibility initiatives and social entrepreneurial ventures. After reviewing the interprofessional literature from various disciplines and professions, the authors categorized them into "competencies," "rationale," "conceptual framework," "principles" and "challenges." An examination of exemplar pedagogy from this body of literature suggests ways to prepare students to lead and actively participate in innovative, collaborative social change initiatives. Findings: Interdisciplinary competencies include teamwork, communication, contextual understanding, negotiation, critical thinking, leadership, openness and adaptability. Interprofessional educational models are difficult to implement, however, ethical responsibility of educators to prepare students for complex realities trumps the challenges. Practical implications: Interprofessional educational experiences can enable students to engage in generative and transformational learning which can later facilitate in creation of innovative solutions for society's recalcitrant physical, social and environmental issues.

abstract={Micro and small businesses contribute the majority of business activity in the most developed economies. They are typically embedded in local communities and therefore well placed to influence community wellbeing. While there has been considerable theoretical and empirical analysis of corporate citizenship and corporate social responsibility (CSR), the nature of micro-business community responsibility (mBCR) remains relatively under-explored. This article presents findings from an exploratory study of mBCR that examined the approaches, motivations and barriers of this phenomenon. Analysis of data from 36 semi-structured interviews with micro-business owner-operators in the Australian city of Brisbane revealed three mBCR approaches, suggesting an observable mBCR typology. Each mBCR type was at least partly driven by enlightened self-interest (ESI). In addition to a pure ESI approach, findings revealed ESI combined with philanthropic approaches and ESI combined with social entrepreneurial approaches. The combination of doing business and doing good found amongst participants in this study suggests that many micro-business owner-operators are supporters of their local communities and, therefore, driven by more than profit. This study provides a fine-grained understanding of micro-business involvement in community wellbeing through a lens of responsible business behaviour. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={Adoption of Local Agenda 21 (LA21) in Europe has been very uneven. However, the embrace (or eager adoption) of LA21-like tools by local governments is usually considered as a requisite to achieve the sustainable development (SD) global aims. This research analyses a successful networking practice in the Basque Country (BC) over an 8-year period in order to identify the main dimensions that explain the embrace of LA21 by Local Governments (LGs). The Basque experience is studied using a qualitative and a quantitative approach. Results show that the factors of entrepreneurial presence (at the regional and local levels), co-decision and co-creation have an effect on local government embrace of the LA21. We also study the motivational mechanisms underlying co-decision and co-creation. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={This paper investigates how small sports clubs (SSCs), the foundations for sporting excellence and significant contributors to the social capital of society in the face of continued financial difficulties, can maximise their fundraising activities. A conceptual framework for investigating the traditional fundraising planning process in the unique context of SSCs is developed and a qualitative methodology is utilised via 19 in-depth interviews in Northern Ireland and Germany to test this model. The findings of this study question the applicability of generic fundraising planning processes for SSCs and emphasise the previously under-realised central role that individual personal competencies play and argue for the application and practice of social entrepreneurship in order to ensure the long-term survival of SSCs.This study makes a contribution to the developing literature on sports marketing and to the important issue of strategic fundraising in the context of SSCs. It highlights the informal, ad-hoc nature of fundraising in many SSCs and provides some direction for how they could become more professional in how they fund their activities and plan for the future development of the clubs. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

As social marketing takes ideas from commercial marketing, this article proposes to transfer the retail-marketing concept of social supermarkets (SSMs), a real- world application, to social marketing. Social supermarkets can be seen as an innovative example of social entrepreneurship, as well as a best-practice benchmark of "new thinking" in social marketing. Social supermarkets sell food and consumer goods that they receive free from retailers and manufacturers for a discount of up to 70% to people who are in or at risk of poverty. The contribution of this article is in defining the concept of social supermarkets founded on social marketing and retail marketing literature and in describing the development and current status of the social supermarket sector in a European country. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

Most donors and volunteers have little interest in the sources of nonprofit organizations' funds.

abstract={The price fluctuation in agricultural markets is an obstacle to poverty reduction for small-scale farmers in developing countries. We build a microfoundation to study how farmers with heterogeneous production costs, under price fluctuations, make cropplanting decisions over time to maximize their individual welfare. We consider both strategic farmers, who rationally anticipate the near-future price as a basis for making planting decisions, and naïve farmers, who shortsightedly react to the most recent crop price. The latter behavior may cause recurring overproduction or underproduction, which leads to price fluctuations. We find it important to cultivate a sufficient number of strategic farmers because their self-interested behavior alone, made possible by sufficient market information, can reduce price volatility and improve total social welfare. In the absence of strategic farmers, a well-designed preseason buyout contract, offered by a social entrepreneur or a for-profit firm to a fraction of contract farmers, brings benefit to farmers as well as to the firm itself. More strikingly, the contract not only equalizes the individual welfare in the long run among farmers of the same production cost, but it also reduces individual welfare disparity over time among farmers with heterogeneous costs regardless of whether they are contract farmers or not. On the other hand, a nonsocially optimal buyout contract may reflect a social entrepreneur's over-subsidy tendency or a for-profit firm's speculative incentive to mitigate but not eliminate the market price fluctuation, both preventing farmers from achieving the most welfare. © 2019 INFORMS.},

abstract={From its pre-Columbian origins, the implementation of the Solidarity Economy has been growing during these last decades in the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean and accelerated the process as it has been developing in the continent of the denominated “New Economy.” This work is a theoretical article with the objective of analyzing the two modern ways of implementing the Solidarity Economy: through the creation of quadruple helix models based on solidarity (Mexico) or through the practical application of McClelland’s N-effect using civil society from virtuous circles of community economic drivers (Puerto Rico). Because of this implementation process, the Solidarity Economy has ceased from being a guild and welfare, to become an economic and financial alternative for economically disadvantaged sectors based on shared values and a shared project. These analyses are complemented by a SWOT analysis and by the theoretical study of the direct relationship between the Solidarity Economy and the combination of social entrepreneurship and transformational entrepreneurship to create, in a novel way, virtuous circles of economic growth. The article concludes with ideas that briefly emphasize the importance of applying open cooperativism in the fight against inequality and poverty. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The existence of social entrepreneurs is beneficial for the establishment of a stable and just society dedicated to serving the needs of individuals and the creation of innovative market solutions. However, social entrepreneurs need an institutional environment of a proper quality to be able to function efficiently. On the one hand, the institutional environment should promote the development of social entrepreneurship, on the other, there is a need for designing direct-action social entrepreneurship institutions that would provide support and ensure the development of socially-oriented businesses, and promote grassroots initiatives in this sphere. Despite the fact that researchers are interested in this issue, there are very few quantitative studies assessing the impact of institutional environments for social entrepreneurs on a global scale. Furthermore, no attempts have been made to look at this phenomenon from an economic development standpoint, by assessing it in developed countries. The subject of the study is social entrepreneurship development and the role of formal institution environment on this process. In this study, the formal institutional environment of social entrepreneurship for developed countries will be investigated econ-ometrically. From this aspect, this study aimed to empirically evaluate whether regulative and normative institutions affect social entrepreneurship growth. As a result of the hypothesis testing, it is determined that a normative institutional environment such as investment freedom or economic growth have a positive influence on the development of social entrepreneurship in developed countries. These findings indicate that social entrepreneurship for its development needs fundamental economic changes and sustainable development. © 2018, Economic Laboratory for Transition Research.

abstract={Purpose: Since 4 September 2010, the greater Christchurch region has endured a series of destructive earthquakes. As a result, food resilience, as a component of community resilience, has become highly relevant. This paper aims to explore the role of social entrepreneurs and the local food system in building community resilience. Design/methodology/approach: Using a quasi-case study method, four social enterprise food initiatives are presented to illustrate conceptually how these local food systems contribute to community resilience in the post-earthquake context in Christchurch. Findings: The results suggest that a generation of social entrepreneurs have emerged, giving rise to networked local food system initiatives that share the common goals of building multiple and unique forms of capital (human, social, natural, financial and physical). In doing so, they have contributed to creating conditions that support community resilience as both a process and an outcome in post-earthquake Christchurch. Research limitations/implications: This research included only four enterprises as the case study, all located in central Christchurch. As such, the results are indicative and may not represent those found in other contexts. Practical implications: The research suggests that social entrepreneurs make a significant contribution to both enhancing food security and building community resilience post-disaster. How policy infrastructure can empower and enable entrepreneurs’ post-disaster warrants further consideration. Social implications: Collectively, the four enterprises included in the research were found to have created local solutions in response to local problems. This embeddedness with and responsiveness to the community is a characteristic of resilient communities. Originality/value: Post-earthquake Christchurch is a living laboratory in relation to understanding community resilience. The processes by which it is occurring, how it is sustained over time and the shapes it will take in the future in such a dynamic environment are not yet understood. This paper contributes to understanding local food systems as part of this process. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Studies on the profile of the social entrepreneurs that use crowdfunding (CF) for financing social projects are relatively rare, specifically in the context of Social Stock Exchange platforms. This research aims to understand the role played by social entrepreneurs’ personality traits on the choice between the traditional donation model and social CF to finance social projects. The particular case of the Portuguese Social Stock Exchange (PSSE) is presented and a quantitative and exploratory approach is used. The data were collected through a questionnaire that was emailed to non-governmental organizations in Portugal and founders of the projects listed on PSSE. Logistic regression is employed to predict the probability that a social entrepreneur would use PSSE rather than traditional financing. The predictor variables are based on the Big Five personality traits. Our investigation reveals that the conscientiousness personality trait is the only factor that might explain the use of the PSSE platform. © The Author(s) 2016.},

abstract={Companies created by women represent a substantial part of entrepreneurship. While men outnumber women in entrepreneurship rates, the gender gap decreases in the case of social enterprises. This may be explained by the fact that roles and stereotypes that influence women's behavior will lead to significantly identify with the values promulgated by social enterprises. This greater involvement in social activities leads women to become an essential player for promoting such needed initiatives given the impossibility for public institutions to address all social problems. Therefore in this paper, firstly, we study the gender gap in social and commercial entrepreneurship, distinguishing between enterprises with less than 42 months of activity and those consolidated in the market. Secondly, and aware of the variability of data between countries, a study is conducted using a sample of 48 countries grouped according to their level of development. The results confirm what is stated in the literature, the gender gap is reduced in the case of social entrepreneurship and it is also shown that female participation in social enterprises is influenced by the level of development of the country. These results lead us to highlight the importance of variables such as culture or social norms when explaining female behavior. © 2016 AEDEM},

This article addresses this research gap and explores how the aims of local development and cultural sustainability defined in the Mexican national tourism program Pueblos Mágicos are put into practice. The analysis is focused on how citizenship, local participation and democracy are operationalized and what are the local consequences of this governmental program in the community of Álamos. By following the constitution and decision-making processes in the local Pueblos Mágicos committee, we demonstrate how different groups bargain on behalf of the 'community' and how they seize the opportunity to promote different development priorities. In particular, we address the role of a North American migrant community in shaping sustainable tourism development as cultural brokers, social entrepreneurs and mediators of market knowledge. The paper criticizes the notion of homogenous local communities as an instrumental condition of sustainable and participatory development. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Teach for All is a good example of a globally travelling educational reform policy. In this article, we examine the rhetoric of the reform through an analysis of its public discourse, specifically the websites for the umbrella organization, 3 of its 35 constituent projects (Teach for America, Teach First and Teach for China) and one associated project (Teach First Norway). The analysis focuses on the rhetorical production of teaching as something done to other people’s children, in places apart from and outside the communities and schools of dominant populations, and for a while only – as a short-term mission rather than what is usually understood as a professional career. We argue that the principal motive underlying Teach for All’s rhetoric is the cultivation of a cadre of leaders and a form of neoliberal social entrepreneurship that it claims will solve the problem of ‘broken’ societies, public services and, specifically, schools. © 2015 The Author(s).

From literature about assessment and impact of entrepreneurship education and social entrepreneurship education, a number of interrelated factors are identified that are important to address in assessment and measurement of impact. In addition to these factors, a supplementary dimension is suggested - the holistic person perspective - in order to offer a measurement approach beyond the borders of a single course or program. From a case study of social entrepreneurship at the Humanities in Denmark, it is described how students develop entrepreneurial experiences both in courses, between courses and in their daily life. The argument of the article is that it can be fruitful to understand entrepreneurial activities in a dynamic and holistic manner with attention to extended time and space dimensions in order to fully capture assessment and impact of entrepreneurship education. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The paper highlights the most popular topics in social innovation research identified in the scientific literature, trying to emphasize the dimensions of the concept and its links with adjacent notions. The paper quantifies the frequency with which social innovation is addressed in the literature and then critically analyses its most debated aspects. The research is based on a literature review of the articles indexed in Thomson Reuters ISI Web of Knowledge during the period 1966-2014. Social innovation as a field of research is rather new but in the last ten years it has gained an amazing popularity among scholars, particularly with respect to pressing social issues like poor education, poverty, hunger, illness or social injustice. It is obvious why this field is more present in research, as social problems that affect a large number of populations are significant and their impact could be scaled and measured appropriately. The paper is meant to help academics and research scholars advance research in the social innovation field, by building on existing streams of research presented in the current paper, which need further investigation. As such, the findings of the paper will have a theoretical applicability and implication in what regards the understanding of the concept of social innovation, as well as its content and links with other related terms. © 2007-2014 Editura Economică.

abstract={This study examines the potential application of the Positive Theory of Social Entrepreneurship to food entrepreneurs. Three food entrepreneurs, who serve both residents and tourists as part of their customer base, were interviewed in semi-structured interview formats about their operations as well as their motivations for beginning each of their businesses; each have a concentrated target market with travelers. The findings showed that each of the three food entrepreneurs had definite traits and motivations associated with not only value creation but also in regards to the four propositions of social entrepreneurship proposed by Santos. Each entrepreneur had a unique and varied approach, however they all were driven by enthusiasm for addressing problems involving neglected positive externalities, operating in areas that would benefit a powerless segment of the population, seeking sustainable solutions, and focusing on empowerment rather than control. Additionally it became apparent that these food entrepreneurs also exhibit traits of Social Constructionists as well as Lifestyle Entrepreneurs. These findings reveal nuanced research opportunities in the field of food and tourism entrepreneurs, advance our understanding of food entrepreneur operations in the retail sector, and introduce a promising new theory to tourism literature. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={The French nonprofit sector has been in existence since July 1, 1901 when the legal form of associations was created. Since then, as a consequence of legal, fiscal, and cultural restrictions, it has developed characteristics that are markedly different to those of other nonprofit sectors. This paper focuses on one such characteristic that makes the French nonprofit sector virtually unique, that is the restrictions imposed on social entrepreneurism. It was not until July 17, 2001 that a new organizational form called Sociétés Coopératives d'Intérêt Collectif (SCIC) was created specifically to address this anomaly. This paper discusses the context within which this organizational form was created, and the potential advantages that it offers in respect to facilitating the development of social enterprises. The paper also explains why a specific organizational form was required and why it was placed outside the nonprofit sector. It concludes by identifying potential problems concerning organizational effectiveness in delivering socially beneficial services and the difficulties that may arise as a consequence of SCIC's unique governance structure. © 2004 International Society for Third-Sector Research and The Johns Hopkins University.},

abstract={Enhancing public real-estate assets has been at the centre of a lively debate in Italy. Public policies have focused on the supply-side, assuming that private demand was ready to develop assets. Yet with the decline in the real-estate market, conditions have greatly changed. Italian authorities begun to experiment new approaches to enhance public assets by supporting the grass-roots participation. The aim of this research is to determine the conditions that can predict the successful outcome of bottom-up value creation dynamics in public real-estate properties. Through a multivariate statistical analysis, the study proposes an interpretation of the elements that determine the successful outcome of bottom-up processes. © 2017 The Author(s).

Specifically, it suggests that what defines social entrepreneurial identity work is the blurring of beatific and horrific aspects of fantasies and a desire for struggle and lack. This in turn creates an emancipatory space in which discursive movement enables alternative forms of market enjoyment and ethical agency. The latter unsettles macro-discourses of capitalism by demanding and amplifying their lack. The study contributes new avenues for exploring Lacanian concepts such as the traversal of fantasy as a product of discursive movement particularly relevant for transformative readings of identity narratives. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.},

abstract={This paper uses institutional theory to highlight different patterns of cross-sector collaboration from the perspective of social enterprises. Specifically, it explores how and why social enterprises interact with mainstream businesses and to what extent their collaboration patterns reflect a vision of how their social mission should be implemented and institutionalized. The empirical analysis is derived from a qualitative study of ‘fair trade’–a hybrid model created by social enterprises and using market mechanisms to support small-scale producers in developing countries and to advocate for changes in international trading practices. The findings highlight three strategies used by fair trade social enterprises to manage their interactions with mainstream businesses: sector solidarity, selective engagement, and active appropriation. This paper suggests that each strategy is motivated by a different vision of how best to articulate the social mission of fair trade via specific types of collaborations. It also notes how each vision has a distinct pattern of institutionalization at the field level. This paper adds to the emergent literatures on social enterprise and social entrepreneurship, fair trade, cross-sector collaboration and hybrid organizing. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={This article sheds light on public performances as important yet neglected sites for social entrepreneurship’s discursive expansion as a fashionable model for social transformation. It approaches the strategic considerations behind presentations aimed at ‘enchanting’ social entrepreneurship through sophisticated investments in spiritual, aesthetic and bodily involvement, and the impressive staging of Muhammad Yunus as a global hero. On a first analytical layer, these ethnographic insights broaden the explanatory basis for social entrepreneurship’s rising popularity. In academic literature, its recent prominence is either accepted as a given fact or critically explored through the theoretical lens of language effects, while modes of conviction that invest in the ‘extra-textual’ are largely ignored. Addressing this gap, the article portrays how organisational actors charged presentations with aesthetic significance, emotional fervour, spiritual dynamism and sensual pleasure to produce holistic experiences that allow people to connect the concept of social entrepreneurship to a felt sense of being-in-the-world. On a second layer, the analysis problematises the enchantment debate’s tendency to construct a secular–spiritual binary, that is, to perceive enchantment as arising either from powerful acts of managerial manipulation or from a deeply human desire to fill a religious void. Complicating this distinction, the article frames enchantment work in the social entrepreneurship field as an ambiguous ‘dance’ between the secular and the sacred—a paradoxical activity of amalgamating neo-rational considerations with the spiritualised pursuit of a global vision. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.},

abstract={The literature reveals a broad range of inconsistencies in defining entrepreneurship and in identifying personal characteristics that predict and explain the phenomena of entrepreneurship. The purpose of this work is to propose a model for consistency in predicting entrepreneurial propensity. This article acknowledges categories of entrepreneurs such as: business enterprise creating entrepreneurs, social entrepreneurs, student entrepreneurs, academic entrepreneurs, and corporate entrepreneurs. The proposed theory is specifically focused on business enterprise creating entrepreneurs, defined as Type One. These are individuals who risk their personal capital, time, and reputation in the pursuit of business ventures. Existing theories and observations regarding affect and personality as characteristics of entrepreneurs are reviewed and a new three-dimensional taxonomy of personal characteristics for predicting Type One entrepreneurial propensity is introduced. Managerial summary: The academic literature has revealed a wide range of definitions of entrepreneurship and this has resulted in inconsistent conclusions for defining and predicting entrepreneurial propensity. This has likely proven problematic for educational institutions interested in expanding entrepreneurial programs, governmental agencies interested in promoting localized economic activity, and lending institutions that wish to strengthen their confidence in entrepreneurs to whom they lend operating capital. This theory article is designed to propose a path to clarity and offer a model for predicting business enterprise creating entrepreneurs. These individuals are defined as Type One entrepreneurs, represented by those who risk their personal capital, time, and reputation in the pursuit of business ventures. A new three-dimensional taxonomy of personal characteristics of these individuals is proposed. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={We live in a world where accountability (and thus the measurement of inputs and outputs) has become an institution due to the increasing demands of stakeholders, and where what gets measured gets valued. The purpose of the hereby paper is to address change and the impact of change upon society. Whether the change is caused by social innovation, social entrepreneurial organizations or social responsibility actions, it translates into a modification in the status quo of the society. Thus, the discourse of our paper revolves around social value, social problem, social entrepreneurship and it connects them to the social impact they generate by presenting the methods used to measure this impact and their basic assumptions, who applies the methods and what are their effects. The methods for measuring the social impact found in the literature lean on quantifying everything in money and they also tend to overlook the importance of the psychological impact a company might have over its target clients. Furthermore, social impact is measured from the perspective of the companies and of the investors, neglecting the customers who are the target of the impact. Also findings reveal that there is no proper legislation to regulate this field and no specialized control bodies to oversee the activity of the third sector regarding social impact. We propose three principles underpinning our own social impact measurement model (sustainability, added value and scalability (spillovers). © 2007-2014 Editura Economică. All rights reserved.},

The research philosophy is based on realism and the research methodology selected is inductive. The data have been collected through secondary sources using case study strategy to present four cases of innovations by social or corporate enterprises at the BOP. The case studies have been chosen from a variable range in terms of BOP countries, social enterprises and multinational companies, for-profit or not-for-profit organisations, and product or business model innovations. Success criteria identified from case studies in the light of academic literature include going beyond selling to the poor, considering BOP groups as producers and BOP engagement. A conceptual framework has been developed from identified criteria and further recommendations for empirically testing the framework to turn it into a model have been provided. © 2013, University of Pretoria.

Participation in social enterprise development brings psychosocial wellbeing benefits, by strengthening family networks, enhancing trust, increasing self-reliance and social esteem and promoting cultural safety. Our objective is to explore how social enterprise activities can meet community needs and foster self-sustainability while generating profits for redistribution as social investment into other ventures that aid social functioning and emotional well-being. Conclusions: Social entrepreneurship enhances both interdependence and independence. Concomitant mental health and social wellbeing dividends accrue overtime to communities engaged in self-determined enterprise activities. Social entrepreneurship builds social capital that supports social wellbeing.

abstract={Joseph Schumpeter's and Israel Kirzner's 'classical' theories of entrepreneurship have contributed much to the field of entrepreneurship but have been underutilized in the emerging field of social entrepreneurship. The argument of this paper is that the utilization of Schumpeterian and Kirznerian theories of entrepreneurship can advance the field of social entrepreneurship in two ways. The first potential contribution from utilizing their classical theories is to guide theory-building for social entrepreneurship. In this paper, a close reading and interpretation of Schumpeter's and Kirzner's work is undertaken alongside a critique of current theories of social entrepreneurship. Five essential theoretical components of Schumpeterian and Kirznerian classical entrepreneurship theories are distilled with respect to social entrepreneurship theory-building: (1) the distinction between entrepreneurial thinking and rational models of decision making; (2) the distinction between entrepreneurship and leadership, capitalism, and management; (3) the ubiquity of entrepreneurship in all human endeavors; (4) the causal functionality of entrepreneurship; and (5) the priority of the process of entrepreneurship over the instrumentality of the entrepreneur. A research proposition is then constructed on each essential theoretical component. The research propositions point to possible research directions for the field of social entrepreneurship, thus representing the second potential contribution of the paper. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Social network analysis has been adopted by a number of governments in their counterinsurgency campaigns. By using network analysis, security agencies claim they can render militant groups impotent by targeting 'nodal points' or key links in insurgent networks. The article makes three arguments on the potentially counterproductive nature of social network analysis-assisted counterinsurgency campaigns. Firstly, social network analysis may be 'too successful' in stripping militant movements of a cadre who could negotiate a peace accord. Secondly, social network analysis-assisted campaigns fail to address the root causes of violent conflict. Thirdly, by denuding communities of social capital and social entrepreneurs, social network analysis - as a counterinsurgency tool - may condemn communities to underdevelopment and failed post-war reconstruction. In short, the 'magic weapon' of social network analysis might actually prolong the conflict it is supposed to help quell. The article employs the government of Sri Lanka's social network analysis-assisted counterinsurgency campaign as a case study, though it also has application to other cases. It concludes by considering if social network analysis can be put to more constructive uses, specifically in the rebuilding of communities after violent conflict. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={While three approaches to societal change have many elements in common, there are notable differences in the preferred research methodologies used. This article offers a review of the research designs in three approaches to organizing societal change: social marketing, social movements and social entrepreneurship. Social entrepreneurship primarily is examined with case studies, network analyses and surveys. Typically, social movements are investigated with qualitative methods, principally case studies. Social marketing shows a strong tendency to evaluate implementations, and experiments are common. These differences in research methodologies are influenced by their foundation disciplines. Social movement is strongly associated with sociology, anthropology and political science. Social entrepreneurship is firmly embedded in business disciplines. Social marketing is allied to psychology and applied extensively in health. Research output also tends to be published in a limited number of discipline relevant journals. While a common foundation offers strengths, it is also a weakness. Cross disciplinary approaches improve research quality by testing assumptions and examining new concepts. Filtering ideas from other fields stimulates new views and may provide useful models or theories. Working beyond the traditions of one discipline enriches the creativity of research. This review suggests employing a variety of research methods offers considerable benefits. The research designs should fit the situation and question being examined. Rigorous and useful societal change research will be produced through combinations of methods that adjust to complexity, adapt to changing conditions, and adjust to varying circumstances. There is significant value in variety of research designs. © 2008 by The Haworth Press.},

abstract={This paper examines the case of an entrepreneurial venture with a disruptive innovation in the field of medical technology. The case entrepreneur is striving for the so-called double bottom line of both financial and social returns. The paper analyses the relationship between the entrepreneur who is both socially responsible and business-oriented and a putative mainstream venture capitalist interested in the financial success of the venture. It is asserted that venture capitalists may not be initially interested in investing due to the social targets of the entrepreneur and due to the disruptive nature of the venture's business concept. In the case company the social goals do not need to be 'sold' to investors as the these are derived automatically from the core business. Any increase in the case venture's business operations leads automatically both to financial profits and social returns. It is discussed whether the bottom-of-the-pyramid (BOP) strategy provides a solution to problems related to disruptive innovations. The theoretical business model applicable in the BOP markets is based on high volumes seeking millions of customers. The use of the high-volume target in the case venture's business is analysed. This may also present a solution to the double-bottom-line problem. The growth in volume automatically raises social returns by creating benefits for an increasingly wider proportion of the population. This case serves as an example of at least two more general problems: (1) the different time-frames of venture capitalists and entrepreneurs; and (2) conflicts of interest between industry incumbents and innovators of new technologies and new business models.},

abstract={The authors of the Education 4.0 concept postulated a flexible combination of digital literacy, critical thinking, and problem-solving in educational environments linked to real-world scenarios. Therefore, teachers have been challenged to develop new methods and resources to integrate into their planning in order to help students develop these desirable and necessary skills; hence, the question: What are the characteristics of a teacher to consider within the framework of Education 4.0? This study was conducted in a higher education institution in Ecuador, with the aim to identify the teaching profile required in new undergraduate programs within the framework of Education 4.0 in order to contribute to decision-making about teacher recruitment, professional training and evaluation, human talent management, and institutional policies interested in connecting competencies with the needs of society. Descriptive and exploratory approaches, where we applied quantitative and qualitative instruments (surveys) to 337 undergraduate students in education programs and 313 graduates, were used. We also included interviews with 20 experts in the educational field and five focus groups with 32 chancellors, school principals, university professors, and specialists in the educational area. The data were triangulated, and the results were organized into the categories of (a) processes as facilitators (b), soft skills, (c) human sense, and (d) the use of technologies. The results outlined the profile of a professor as a specialized professional with competencies for innovation, complex problem solving, entrepreneurship, collaboration, international perspective, leadership, and connection with the needs of society. This research study may be of value to administrators, educational and social entrepreneurs, trainers, and policy-makers interested in implementing innovative training programs and in supporting management and policy decisions. © 2021 by the authors.

In this context, social economy companies play an essential role in the promotion of sustainable growth. This research wants to present the importance of social entrepreneurship in the organizational performance of a company. It also aims to show the positive relationship between the extent to which social entrepreneurship is implemented and the creation of distinctive marketing competences, as well as the mediating role these competences have between social entrepreneurship and organizational performance. For this purpose, an analysis of 221 Spanish social-economic entities has been developed from January to May 2014. In order to evaluate organizational performance, a validated scale has been used (Nakata, 2008), since it integrates sociometric characteristics that are necessary for this research. For the two remaining constructs, that is to say, social entrepreneurship and distinctive marketing competences, specific items have been developed by taking into consideration the analysis of their sociometric properties that could lead to the validation of the relationship among the three proposed variables. The results show a positive relationship between the extent to which an organization introduces social entrepreneurship and its organizational performance, social entrepreneurship and the creation of distinctive marketing competences, as well as the influence of distinctive marketing competences as a mediating variable in the relationship between the degree of implementation of social entrepreneurship and organizational performance. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Responsible innovation combines philanthropic and economic aspects and it is common to refer to entrepreneurs who lead it as "social entrepreneurs". The present study of 100 Mexican small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), provides knowledge of an exploratory nature about what the models of organization are conducive to SMEs in the generation and development of responsible innovations. Through the statistical technique of cluster analysis, this study identified and characterized four models of organization according to the level of social entrepreneurship intentions reached: (1) "The techno-scientific organization", (2) "The techno-social organization", (3) "The capitalist-social organization" and (4) "The capitalist organization". While in Europe the dominant discourse about responsible innovation focuses on the control of the risk of social rejection of the advance of science and technology. In contexts, such as the Mexicans, the phenomenon is configured as the mechanism through which entrepreneurs articulate its technological and scientific capabilities to solve priority and specific problems of the society, however, the social impact does not crucially affect their business initiatives. The techno-scientific organization (50% of studied SMEs) is proposed as the model of organization with greater viability for Mexican entrepreneurs. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Purpose: Taking China as a research context, the purpose of this paper is to delineate how social and business tensions manifest in Chinese nascent social enterprises and to disentangle the strategies that they adopt to manage the business-social dual goals to achieve organizational viability. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative multiple-case study is used to collect and analyze data. Empirical data are drawn from in-depth semi-structured interviews with Chinese social entrepreneurs, ethnographic observation of social enterprises as well as secondary sources. Findings: Depending on personal motivations and resource availability, social entrepreneurs’ perceptions toward pursuit of dual goals range from integration to differentiation in the short term, despite consensus on the concurrent development in the long term. The leverage of resources, image management, continuous innovation and need-based services are viable approaches that Chinese social enterprises adopt to manage the dual goals in order to create both social and economic value. Research limitations/implications: This paper reveals understanding of the concrete tensions experienced among Chinese nascent social enterprises in pursuing business and social goals and how they manage to integrate the synergistic aspects of social and business goals to achieve survival and growth. Based primarily on qualitative case study method, the research findings are context specific and may not be ideal for generalization. Practical implications: The authors reveal strategies by which synergistic benefits between dual goals may be achieved. Innovation (e.g. in resource utilization, in service format and content) and differentiation (e.g. in organization positioning) would be beneficial in enhancing the competitiveness of social enterprises. To enhance organizations’ credibility, quality of products and service should be monitored and organizational transparency needs to be enhanced. Social implications: It is suggested that the government specifies legal forms and legitimates interests of social enterprises, formulates preferential policies to stimulate the development of social enterprises, and develops a set of qualification authentication system to regulate this emerging sector. Originality/value: The study examines the manifestation of business and social tensions and presents dual-goal management strategies from a non-western perspective. As an original contribution to the field of social entrepreneurship, the study responds to calls for in-depth analysis of conflicting objectives and tension management in social enterprises. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Social entrepreneurship develops innovative opportunities and solutions aimed to (re)generate the common good. This emerging organizational form poses unprecedented challenges to group decision and negotiation studies. This article leverages conceptual tools from the literature on the commons and institutional logics as it explores the organizational conditions of social entrepreneurship that trigger commons-enabling decision-making in its organizational field. Through an inductive analysis of a longitudinal case, this study proposes a model that highlights the critical role of the bridging organization that can be introduced by the social entrepreneur in a previously fragmented organizational field. This bridging organization is in the condition to develop an innovative co-creation logic that can serve as a common ground to enable collaboration between actors from diverse and even conflicting institutional logics. The proposed model suggests that a practice-driven path to the construction of such a common ground for decision-making is more effective than a disclosure-driven path, which is based on classical conflict analysis techniques. The ICT-enabled activity system developed by the social entrepreneur injects transparency and traceability into a previously opaque field, thus creating the conditions for distributed, flexible, and complementary sense- and decision-making processes that develop and protect the commons. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Entrepreneurship scholars have become increasingly aware of the need to recognize situated and temporary practices as the core of organizing in general, and of entrepreneuring as a processual phenomenon in particular. Close-up and longitudinal empirical inquiry into a Swedish work-integrating social enterprise, and its everyday procedures, uncovered several core process practices. The transformation of this enterprise into a national franchisor constructed further processual practices. These practices are comparable with the principles constituting the logic of effectuation. The findings tell that a different kind of effectuation logic rules in social enterprises, as much as the task is not profit-making but supporting people with social needs. The notion of ‘necessity effectuation’ is thus introduced to denote this logic. The empirical research in the social enterprise also reveals structural practices, here interpreted as dualities, that frame the processual practices. In social entrepreneuring a weaving metaphor, with the structural practices as the warp and the processual ones as the weft elements, thus appears as appropriate. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Purpose: Research on economic entrepreneurship identifies a gender gap that is favorable to men. In the social entrepreneurship arena, the existing evidence is slightly fuzzy, as this gender gap is less preeminent. This paper aims to identify how gender differences in social entrepreneurial ventures creation are explained by different personality traits, by analyzing the extent to which female and male social entrepreneurs exhibit the same personality traits and whether potential differences are able to explain the differences in predisposition for the creation of new social entrepreneurial ventures. Design/methodology/approach: A review of the literature on gender differences and personality traits in social entrepreneurship details the main theoretical developments and builds the hypotheses. Based on the Big Five model, the investigation uses a hypothesis testing quantitative approach. Primary data were collected through a questionnaire that was e-mailed and applied to the social entrepreneurs engaged in the creation of social ventures in Portugal. Findings: The data gathered suggest that both female and male social entrepreneurs have personalities characterized by high levels of openness to experience, agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion and emotional stability. Based on the analysis of variance (ANOVA) between the two groups and logistic regression, the investigation reveals that women and men who launch a new social venture only differ in one personality dimension – agreeableness – wherein women scored more highly. No significant differences are found in the other personality traits. Research limitations/implications: The research assumes that most aspects of human personality structure are represented in the Big Five model. Practical implications: The knowledge about whether gender differences are explained by different personality traits is critical to public entities that might design appropriate public policies to stimulate social entrepreneurship. Also, social entrepreneurs’ capacity building programs should be delineated in accordance with a deeper understanding about gender and personality traits differences. Social implications: The knowledge of the factors that affects the creation of new social ventures has an important potential contribution on social value creation and the promotion of gender equality. Originality/value: This paper links two important topics – gender and entrepreneurs’ personality traits – scarcely explored in the social entrepreneurship literature. Thus, the paper adds new empirical evidence to support (or not) the belief that personality and gender matter in the decision to launch a new social venture. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Despite the burgeoning research on social enterprise (SE), there is a dearth of research that investigates the biographical factors that influence the emergence of SEs in the form of hybrid organizations on a large scale. Drawing on the emerging narrative perspective of SE, we examine the biographical narratives of 317 self-identified social entrepreneurs who were selected as fellows by two of the world’s largest SE support organizations: Ashoka and the Schwab Foundation. We employ Gioia’s methodology and principal component analysis to derive and subsequently classify the biographical antecedents of SE emergence. This study makes a novel contribution to the SE-as-hybrid-organization literature by revealing eight biographical antecedents of SE emergence, four of which can be categorized into social skills, and four others can be categorized into economic skills, which constitute SE’s social position. We also develop a typology of SE based on different combinations of individuals’ social skills and social position. Finally, we discuss the implications of this study for the SE-as-hybrid-organization literature, highlight its limitations, and present possible avenues for future research. © 2017, International Society for Third-Sector Research and The Johns Hopkins University.},

abstract={This paper explores the emancipatory impulse of Indigenous social innovation and social enterprise. Indigenous approaches to solving social disparities reflect a perpetual search for innovative ways to change the circumstances of Māori. Power is an understudied dimension of social innovation and social enterprise. This paper explores the power dynamics that structure the disadvantage and marginalisation that cause populations to be underserved by markets and that limit their access to resources. We highlight that it is not power per se that enables social change: rather, it is power shifts. Through a single, richly contextualised case study of a well-known Māori social innovator, Dr Lance O'Sullivan, we reveal and illustrate the nuances of Indigenous entrepreneurship in the Far North of Aotearoa New Zealand. The case epitomises the transformative impact a social entrepreneur can have on the provision of healthcare amid market and policy failures. © 2018 Cambridge University Press and Australian and New Zealand Academy of Management.},

abstract={PurposeSocial entrepreneurship by hoteliers in “going green” promotes a better future for the environment and arguably also for the human race. However, going green potentially increases costs for both hoteliers and their guests. Environmental education (EE) is possibly a useful vehicle for the hotel industry to gain support for greener operations. This research aims to investigate the potential impact of EE on increasing customer uptake of green hotels. Design/methodology/approachA survey was conducted to collect data from three winners of a green hotel competition. Six surveyors were dispatched, and 155 usable responses were obtained. Data were analyzed with AMOS 16.0 to estimate an structural equation modeling (SEM) model of how EE affects environmental motivation (EM) and how this relates to visitors’ intentions. FindingsModel estimation shows that a moderating variable effect exists between EE and visitors’ intentions. The cause is approximately 40 per cent direct and 60 per cent mediated through EM. That environmental education affects visit intention for green hotels both directly and through creating environmental motivation is evidence that the hotel industry can expect to enhance the use of their socially responsible green services by facilitating EE. In research terms, how best to invest in EE to support the social entrepreneurship of hotels providing green services is a research area to pursue for developing criteria to maximize benefits while supporting business viability. Originality/valueThis study shows that social entrepreneurs who provide green services can expand their area of social responsibility and generate more potential customers by supporting EE. The findings and applications of this study are useful both for academia and practitioners. © 2016, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to examine the motivations of social entrepreneurs. It explores the case of the Gathering in Ireland in 2013, when against a backdrop of recession, the national Government encouraged individuals and communities to organize events and invite the Diaspora to visit Ireland as a way of helping the country to revitalize. Some 5,000 events took place across the country during the year, and this paper examines this in the context of social entrepreneurship. Three research questions are posed: Who were these tourism and social entrepreneurs who organized events as a result of the Gathering? What motivated them to engage in these activities? Will this social entrepreneurship activity be maintained beyond 2013 and how has it been impacted by the Gathering? Design/methodology/approachThe empirical research was conducted in two counties in Ireland, Co. Kerry and Co. Westmeath. The research tools used were key informant interviews, a survey of event organizers and focus groups. FindingsKey findings show that the Gathering has resulted in the emergence of new social entrepreneurs, but it has also had a positive impact on those who had run their events before, as it made them be more strategic in the way they planned and ran their event and also resulted in them thinking about these events in terms of tourists rather than just the local community. They also developed new skills which will aid their future development. It is clear that social entrepreneurs can play a fundamental role in the development of tourism destinations, and this is an important topic for researchers in tourism to be concerned about. Originality/valueThe originality of this paper lies in the fact that it addresses the issue of motivation of social entrepreneurs and challenges us to think more about how these types of entrepreneurs identify the problem that they will address. Furthermore, this case shows that the motivation for such action can be prompted by a national strategy, rather than as the literature heretofore represented it as an innate motivation that materialized and developed within particular individuals. © 2016, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the use of income generation projects as a pedagogic method to assess students’ learning about social enterprises. The authors are interested in how and why this innovative approach might improve students’ understanding of the different aspects and attributes of social entrepreneurship. Design/methodology/approach: The study used thematic analysis of qualitative data comprising the reflective logs of 87 students on an undergraduate entrepreneurship module in a university business programme. The major attributes of social entrepreneurship were identified from a review of literature, and the paper uses the logs to judge whether students had learnt about these attributes. Findings: The results show that students developed an understanding concerning social enterprises’ diverse stakeholder environment, market needs, social enterprises’ ideological foundations, resource mobilisation processes and performance measurement – both social and financial. In addition, they developed skills in reflection and self-awareness, communication, empathy and the generation of new ideas. Research limitations/implications: The study is limited in that it focused on only one cohort of students, undergraduates. The authors cannot claim that the findings are generalisable to other students or contexts. Practical implications: Students are better able to understand the needs and values of social enterprises. However, this is a resource intensive process for educators with implications for curriculum design and management. Social implications: This study sheds new light on how experiential learning helps to raise students’ awareness of social enterprises. Originality/value: This study sheds new light on how experiential learning in the form of income generation projects helps to raise students’ awareness of social enterprises. Its value lies in helping to develop a novel and effective pedagogy for entrepreneurial learning. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

We explore the issue of social franchising through case study analyses of four social franchises active in the United Kingdom from a social network theory perspective and through the argument of embeddedness. The influence of relational embeddedness and its eight core variables were found to play the preeminent role in the formation, partner selection, and performance and were examined. In addition, the study showed that the biggest challenges that social franchisors face are the creation of a straightforward clear model, the training of the partners to a different operationally wise and commercially wise culture, and their ability to focus on supporting the whole network. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={The Internet allows advocacy organizations to reach a large audience in an efficient way. When such advocacy organizations predominantly act online, they are termed dotcauses. Dotcauses play an increasingly important role in creating and maintaining social movements that are aimed at promoting sustainability. Yet, like offline social movements, dotcauses still need to exploit and mobilize resources, such as donations, media attention, and moral support, and they still need to be efficient and creative for the promotion of their social cause. Unfortunately, the social movement and social entrepreneurship streams of research have tended to produce separate literatures despite their potential synergies. We bring together both streams by using process models from social entrepreneurship and social movement theory to analyze the actions of dotcauses for sustainability. Additionally, we explore to what extent the Internet supports the actions of dotcauses and reveal which ethical considerations arise from combining entrepreneurship and activism. We collect data on eight dotcauses via semi-structured interviews and desk research. Our cross-case analysis reveals two types of dotcauses: online social entrepreneurs that partner up with firms and online entrepreneurial activists that target firms for protest. These two types differ substantially with regard to their collective identity and their ethical considerations. Our findings show that the Internet enables advocacy organizations to act in a more entrepreneurial and open manner. We suggest directions for future research, including a combination of social movement theory and social entrepreneurship theory to describe and explain the role of the Internet in processes of organizational change.

abstract={Responding to a number of longstanding challenges such as poverty, wide-ranging inequalities, environmental problems, and migration, requires new and creative responses that are often not provided by traditional governments. Social innovations can offer socio-ecological and economic solutions by introducing new practices that reduce social inequalities, disproportionate resource use and foster sustainable development. Understanding the role of social innovations is especially complicated in unstable institutional environments, e.g. in developing countries and countries in transition. This paper analyses nine social innovations in rural areas in Serbia, based on in-depth interviews and document analysis. This analysis reveals factors that facilitate or constrain social innovations whilst simultaneously identifying related formal and informal institutional voids, for example, poor law enforcement, a lack of adequate infrastructure, lack of trust, as well as norms and values that bolster patriarchal systems. The results that emerged from this research show that social innovations are operating in spite of these challenges and are facilitating improvements in a number of the aforementioned challenging areas. Some innovators engage in social entrepreneurship activities because of subsistence-oriented goals, while others follow idealistic or life-style oriented goals, thus creating new social values. Moving beyond these observations, this paper also identifies means to overcome institutional voids, such as creation of context-specific organisational structures, improved legal frameworks, and innovative financial mechanisms. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={While social bricolage has emerged as a key theoretical frame for understanding how social entrepreneurs mobilize and deploy resources to create social value under situations of resource scarcity, there is scant knowledge about social bricolage in post-conflict settings characterised by extreme resource paucity and adversity. Drawing on field research in post-conflict northern Uganda, we show how groups of disenfranchised young people use social bricolage to create social change in a volatile situation marked by extreme resource deprivation and a plethora of challenges arising in the aftermath of war. Based on empirical data, we outline three key practices of social bricolage employed to cope with resource scarcity, extended crisis and volatility. First, we unravel the practice of securing resources and creating social value by mobilizing peers. Second, we show how pluriactivity is used to stretch and make the most of scarce resources in a shifting environment. Third, we illuminate the practice of rekindling pre-war cultural resources to reunite fragmented communities. By illuminating these practices and showing how the context of the post-conflict developing country setting influences the dynamics of ‘making do with resources at hand’, we seek to extend social bricolage theory. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={The paper investigates the emerging practice of social crowdfunding. It focuses on both the role played by crowdfunding platforms and the activities that these platforms perform in enhancing and facilitating the diffusion of social and cultural projects through donations. Crowdfunding platforms empower the financing of projects by soliciting small investments from a large base of potential backers over the Internet and creating a dynamic funding network. However, crowdfunding platforms should also create greater legitimacy for social enterprises by promoting early societal interaction and participation. To explore the context of social crowdfunding, the paper examines the case of the Italian social crowdfunding platform – Meridonare – by using both primary and secondary data sources. Findings reveal that, beyond acting as a standard crowdfunding platform, Meridonare eases interactions and relationships among different stakeholders. The emerging set of relationships gives rise to a Social Crowdfunding Business Ecosystem (SCBE), with the crowdfunding platform acting as a hub to enact knowledge sharing and service provision to a plethora of different actors. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Rewards based crowdfunding (where individuals provide funding for a campaign in exchange for a pre-specified reward) represents one of the largest forms of crowdfunding to date. While an emerging stream of research examines how the rhetoric used in crowdfunding campaigns impacts funding success, a number of studies examining language used in crowdfunding have only been explored in the context of social crowdfunding campaigns that rely on very different audiences, funding amounts, and project goals. To build knowledge surrounding the relationship between the rhetoric used in rewards-based crowdfunding and potential campaign success we replicate a number of rhetoric approaches previously examined in social contexts. Specifically, we examine the efficacy of charismatic rhetoric, political rhetoric, entrepreneurial orientation rhetoric, and virtue rhetoric in a sample of 1000 campaigns drawn from Kickstarter. Our replication results reveal relatively little consistency across contexts underscoring the value of replication to understand boundary conditions of important entrepreneurial phenomena. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={In explaining the emergence of new strategic action fields, in which social movements’ and organizations’ logic, rules and strategies are forged, inter-field dynamics remain under-explored. The case of Social Enterprise and Entrepreneurship (SEE) shows how new fields can emerge through field encroachment, whereby shifts among overlapping fields create structural opportunities for the ascendency of new fields, which may adapt logics borrowed from adjacent fields to construct legitimacy. SEE leveraged the 1980s’ shift between first-order market and state fields to encroach on the political strategies of community organizing, birthing a neoliberal social movement to create a new field addressing social problems using market-based, profit-motivated approaches. With its borrowed veneer of justice, SEE rapidly developed a high academic and public profile over just three decades, despite little evidence its approach to solving social problems works. In encroaching on proven political strategies for solving social problems, it may further undermine democratic practices. © The Author(s) 2019.

abstract={The purpose of this empirical study is to examine the relationship between social entrepreneurship and sustainable enterprise development. Four dimensions of social entrepreneurship i.e. social mission, social innovation, social networking, and financial returns are regressed with three dimensions of sustainable enterprise development i.e. social, environmental, and economic. In current literature, most of the work in the field of social entrepreneurship is qualitative in nature and none of the existing studies explained the impact of labeling "social enterprise" as a source of enterprise sustainability and this study used positivist paradigm to test this impact. Data was collected from social entrepreneurs and employees of social enterprises via online questionnaire (n=434) developed and distributed through "Google Docs". Social entrepreneurs from 41 different countries participated in online survey. The results of the study reveal that social entrepreneurship results in sustainable enterprise development. The study supports the fact that one of the important factors in enterprise development is the way the enterprise is managed and the label of "social enterprise" is resulting in sustainable development of social enterprise itself. The research contributes to literature by empirically testing the relationship between social entrepreneurship and sustainable enterprise development which was never tested before. The study used a unique methodology that results in gathering of data from 41 countries of the world. This results of this study can be used by social entrepreneurs to create more positive impact for the society. © 2017 Johar Education Society, Pakistan.},

abstract={Cooperatives are considered potential organizational vehicles for society's development due to their multiple objectives and diverse roles. Therefore, this study aims to understand which factors associated with agricultural cooperatives can impact on society. The research adopted a quantitative methodology with the data-collecting instrument being a questionnaire applied to 194 cooperators belonging to wine cooperatives in the Dão region of Portugal. The results indicate that agricultural cooperatives have multiple impacts on their members and are considered an organizational format able to promote society's development. The empirical study also reveals two factors/dimensions that confirm the social importance of wine cooperatives in society: (1) reaction and (2) cooperation. Despite the difficulties in improving their competitiveness, cooperatives are seen as important vehicles for mobilization of local resources into a critical mass and their cooperators can achieve significant economic and social benefits from participation. In this sense, social entrepreneurship plays a vital role in the process of society/community development as well as making a significant contribution to cooperators. Implications for theory and practice are also suggested. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

Understanding the boundaries of social entrepreneurship as well as its relations to these other areas of research is increasingly important as these sub-fields continue to evolve. We provide a clear and concise delineation of social entrepreneurship as a research domain to aid future researchers attempting to understand how social entrepreneurship connects to these other streams of research.

abstract={Purpose: This paper aims to explore the emergence and nature of impact investment in Australia and how it is shaping the development of the social enterprise sector. Design/methodology/approach: Impact investment is an emerging approach to financing social enterprises that aims to achieve blended value by delivering both impact and financial returns. In seeking to deliver blended value, impact investment combines potentially conflicted logics from investment, philanthropy and government spending. This paper utilizes institutional theory as a lens to understand the nature of these competing logics in impact investment. The paper adopts a sequential exploratory mixed methods approach to study the emergence of impact investment in Australia. The mixed methods include 18 qualitative interviews with impact investors in the Australian market and a subsequent online questionnaire on characteristics of impact investment products, activity and performance. Findings: The findings provide empirical evidence of the rapid growth in impact investment in Australia. The analysis reveals the nature of institutional complexity in impact investment and highlights the risk that the impact logic may become overshadowed by the investment logic if the difference in rigor around financial performance measurement and impact performance measurement is maintained. The paper discusses the implications of these findings for the development of the Australian social enterprise sector. Originality/value: This paper provides empirical evidence on the emergence of impact investment in Australia and contributes to a growing global body of evidence about the nature, size and characteristics of impact investment. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Factor analyses supported that personality traits could be divided into dimensions of extraversion, openness to experience, neuroticism, conscientiousness and agreeableness; creativity could be divided into dimensions of originality and usefulness; and social capital could be divided into dimensions of bridging and bonding. The results from multiple regression analysis revealed that openness negatively predicted social entrepreneurial intentions, whereas originality positively predicted social entrepreneurial intentions. However, no direct association was found between social capital and social entrepreneurial intentions. The reason for the negative relationship between openness and social entrepreneurial intentions, which contradicted our initial claim, is discussed. © 2018, © 2018 SAGE Publications.},

Unfortunately, existing research has failed to address to what extent SEs are truly living up to their promises. In result, surprisingly little is known about the actual success of SEs in creating social impact. Even more elementary, it is hard to know whether SEs are measuring and monitoring their social impact. Using a worldwide sample of 3.194 SEs from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) data this study provides unique insights, as it represents the first global and harmonized assessment of the practice of impact measurement of SEs. Findings show that about 33% of the SEs in the sample do measure their impact. Furthermore, the results show a significant positive relation between economic mission, size and innovativeness of the SE and impact measurement. The relation between social mission and impact measurement show a significant negative result. These results can be seen as a starting point in investigating the actual practice of SEs involvement in impact measurement and opens up interesting avenues for future research. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={How do social entrepreneurs employ language to bring about a change in the structure of society and institutions? Drawing on discourse as the main epistemology in institutional theory, this research applies corpus linguistics (CL)–a relatively new approach in studying discourse–to identify the institutional-change work performed by social entrepreneurs. By applying CL on a small, specialized corpus of a Chinese social enterprise (SE) that offers taxi services to a specialty market–elders and physically disabled residents–and has institutionalized wheelchair accessible transportation in Hong Kong (China), this research found 17 discourse orientations (i.e., problem, difficulty, empowerment, beneficiary, altruistic, social process, economic, opportunity, sustainability, partnership, resource, solution, government-as-enabler, social business identity, change-making, mission, and impact) that can be aggregated into five meta discourses: problematization, empowerment, marketization, resource mobilization, and publicness. It also reveals the influence of collaborative efforts performed by volunteers, media, educational institutions and the State in institutionalizing and legitimizing wheelchair accessible public transport and social enterprises. This study also uncovers the influence of prior institutional context on the institutionalization of SE. This research suggests new avenues to better integrate social work, public administration, and sustainability research–cognate disciplines at the fringes of SE–to inform future SE research. Finally, this study articulates the promise of corpus linguistics as a primary or supplementary method for future SE discourse research. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Objective: The paper aims to analyse theoretically and empirically the development of social entrepreneurship in Poland and Lithuania, emphasizing the development of appropriate skills and abilities gained at university as entrepreneurial opportunity. Research Design & Methods: The research undertaken for the purposes of the paper is based on a literature review and empirical research partly devoted to a situational analysis of social entrepreneurship in Poland, as well as a pilot survey of target groups pertaining to the entrepreneurial skills and abilities as entrepreneurial opportunity of Lithuanian and Polish students as potential social entrepreneurs. Findings: The main research findings imply that despite the existence of entrepreneurial opportunity as education at university, social entrepreneurship is increasingly important in Poland. Overall support is needed for the creation of social enterprises and attracting young people to them. Empirical research based on Lithuanian and Polish students’ perception of acquiring entrepreneurial skills and abilities at university can be entrepreneurial opportunity for social entrepreneurship. Implications & Recommendations: Implementing further research in the field, as empirical this research was just a pilot one. Research can be developed by taking into account more respondents in both countries.

abstract={Social and commercial entrepreneurship are often said to be two contrasting disciplines that are, at best, only tenuously related. Even though there is a lack of consensus on how to define both social and commercial entrepreneurship, most definitions of social entrepreneurship commonly state that solving social problems demands a narrow, specialised focus, whilst commercial entrepreneurship is often seen as a more conventionally 'business'-like activity. In this article, we put forward our arguments using theoretical discussion backed up by practical case studies to show that many of today's commercial business models are based on ideas with a social intention. Our findings on the economic importance of innovative social business ideas highlight the importance of social entrepreneurship, and the importance of encouraging social aspects in teaching, practical entrepreneurship support and research. In fact, we even find that social and commercial entrepreneurship are highly interrelated phenomena, which should not be treated as separate disciplines. © 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={While effectual decision making has been studied in the private sector entrepreneurship literature as a way to explain the entrepreneurial start-up process, it also has potential application in the public and nonprofit sectors. Effectuation can be used to explain the decision process used by actors in the nonprofit sector, particularly in understanding how social entrepreneurs make decisions during the development of a nonprofit or social venture. We distinguish between causal and effectual decision making and illustrate the latter through two case studies of nonprofit start-up in the community development arena. These studies indicate that effectual decision making is particularly suited to the start-up social entrepreneurship venture. Differences between causal and effectual decision making influence the way actors prepare for the future and have pedagogical implications for how we teach social entrepreneurship. Training social entrepreneurs in effectual decision making has potential to better mirror real-world applications and may increase a venture’s ultimate success. Effectuation could also potentially explain decision making in other public arenas. © The Author(s) 2013.},

abstract={Innovative responses are necessary to address persistent and intertwined problems such as poverty, resource degradation, or food insecurity. There is a growing expectation for business to play a proactive role in this, but there are still remarkable gaps in our understanding of how exactly business can generate social and environmental innovation. This book focuses on the business of social and environmental innovation in the African context, where these issues are particularly relevant but even less well understood. The following chapter sets the scene by introducing the key concepts and issues at stake. We argue that the emergence of social and environmental innovation is often associated with individual efforts of social entrepreneurs, organizational transformation in incumbent businesses, and/or cross-sector partnerships as collective efforts. This is reflected in the sequence of the chapters in this volume. We identify four cross-cutting themes which are addressed in some way or other by each of the contributing chapters: (1) social innovation as a process or outcome; (2) mapping and scaling up innovations; (3) tension between social purpose and profit generation; and (4) socio-economic and institutional context. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={Social entrepreneurship has been defined until now by borrowing insights from commercial, Schumpeterian entrepreneurship as well as a new way of looking at non-profit work (Peredo and McLean, 2006; Short et al., 2009). Inspired by the use of a competence perspective to define entrepreneurship (European Commission, 2005), our main purpose in this article is to apply a competence perspective to social entrepreneurship, using a multidimensional framework. We start by looking at social entrepreneurship in the context of commercial entrepreneurship research. Next, we describe the concepts of competence and entrepreneurial competence as building blocks for our view. Then, we describe the research of the concept of competence for social entrepreneurship among 103 founders of social enterprises in Romania. Our main findings suggest that social entrepreneurship competence is comprised of a large spectrum of social and functional competences (rather than cognitive competence) and motivation to solve social problems.

abstract={Social entrepreneurship has been gaining increasing attention as a possible employment strategy for people with disabilities. However, little is known about the experiences of social entrepreneurs with disabilities in relation to their resources needs, opportunities for participation, and barriers they encounter. Further, little is understood about how social entrepreneurship differs from self-employment or forms of commercial entrepreneurship. The findings included herein are representative of the first empirical research integrating the fields of disability studies and entrepreneurship studies to explore social entrepreneurship among people with disabilities through interviews with key stakeholders working in the field (n = 19) and focus groups with social entrepreneurs with disabilities themselves (n = 27). Three themes emerged from this qualitative research that hold particular importance to policymakers and professionals working in the field of vocational rehabilitation: 1) education, training and information; 2) finance, funding and asset development; 3) networking and supports. The findings demonstrate that social entrepreneurship can be an effective model of employment but is currently underutilized. With additional investment, it can offer a meaningful way for people with disabilities to participate in the labor market and complement existing strategies in competitive and customized employment to promote choice and self-determination. © 2013 - IOS Press and the authors.},

abstract={The social policy agenda will be marked by an ageing population on a global scale and by increased and diversified expectations from citizens in the need of work and social service in the decades to come. Public budgets for social service such as health, education and welfare including social work practice will be put under increasing pressure. There is a difference between a social economy approach to the third sector and an approach based upon the notion of a non-profit constraint. Social economy is well positioned as a third sector to play a core role in meeting this urgency. But how does the social economy fit with current strategies in the areas of welfare policies and social service? Is it as a certain type of social entrepreneurship an integral part of a social innovation of the mainstream market economy or is it part of an emerging counter discourse in the sense of a participatory non-capitalist economy in the area of social service and social innovation? This paper will define social economy in relation to third sector, and argue that it must be seen as a distinct type of social practice as well as being inter-related to social enterprise and social entrepreneurship. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={We develop a theoretical framework, based on a moneylender-firm relationship with moral hazard, to investigate whether enterprise capital structure differs between for-profit and nonprofit sectors. The nondistribution constraint of the nonprofit organizations increases the fraction of own capital on total investment: according to our theoretical predictions, this reduces leverage, defined as the amount borrowed over the total investment. By contrast, the intrinsically high commitment of nonprofit entrepreneurs weakens the moral hazard problem: this augments leverage. We then analyze a longitudinal data set of balance sheets of 504 firms operating in the social residential sector in Italy. Our empirical analysis shows that once controlled for observable characteristics, for-profit companies have a leverage 6% higher than nonprofit enterprises, even if the latter face lower credit costs. We explain this finding by arguing that the effect of the nondistribution constraint prevails over the effect of the social entrepreneurs' intrinsic motivation. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.},

This article presents the strategies they employ, such as building new positive attractors (i.e., social capital) outside the field of influence of the conflict attractors; as a next step, they build a feedback loop between the success of their initiatives and reinforcement of social capital. Through subsequent positive experiences, they introduce constructive change outside of the field of conflict in a manner that modifies the societal balance based on higher levels of trust and tendencies to cooperate. Through this strategy, they make conflict less relevant and less salient.

abstract={The number of theories of innovation systems has grown considerably over the past two decades and several innovation system approaches have been developed. The focus of most has been on the development of technological innovations which create economic value.However, addressing macro-level societal problems – sociotechnical and environmental challengesin which the production, dissemination and use of social and technical knowledge and technology can potentially resolve the problem – has been overlooked. The present study argues that in order to resolve such problems, a combination of technical innovations (covering the technological aspects of the problem) and social innovations (covering the social aspects of the problem) are required.Instead of focusing on the development of a particular technology or industry, an innovation system must focus on solving problems; it must utilize technical innovations alongside economic and social innovations to do so.To this end, the present study highlights the need for a framework for the analysis of macro-level societal problems by reviewing innovation systems literature and proposes a new approach named “Problem-oriented innovation systems”. We conceptualize this approach based on event history analysis and through case study of the US air pollution problem and the way it was successfully resolved by using technical and social innovations.The results show that a problem-oriented innovation system has eight functions: System monitoring and guidance, technical and social knowledge creation, technical and social entrepreneurship, knowledge dissemination, collaboration and synergy, public awareness, standardization and resource mobilization. Finally, a framework for analyzing the innovation process is proposed to solve the macro-level societal problem. This approach can be used to solve global problems such as global warming and climate change which ask for collaboration among different countries. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Purpose: Social entrepreneurship courses are among the fastest growing category of course offerings to entrepreneurship students (Brock and Kim, 2011) because both high growth potential- and steady growth-social ventures can create value and help solve social issues effectively and efficiently. As knowledge disseminators, entrepreneurship educators are in prime position to develop the knowledge, skills and abilities of students, which, in turn, increases their intentions to start a social venture and their ability to manage and grow their venture. Students gain an understanding about the role of entrepreneurship in addressing social opportunities, as well as knowledge related to starting, managing and growing social entrepreneurship ventures. This paper is divided into three parts. First, the authors broadly discuss the concept of social entrepreneurship. Second, the authors present an overview of the field of social entrepreneurship education (SEE) and its evolution. Finally, the authors supplement this review with an analytical examination of SEE, in which the authors present results of a cross-country analysis survey of over 200 entrepreneurship education programs in the USA and Canada. This paper aims to present information about: student enrollment in social entrepreneurship courses in comparison to other entrepreneurship courses; the frequency of offering social entrepreneurship courses and programs compared to other entrepreneurship courses and programs; and future trends in SEE. The results revealed a strong demand for social entrepreneurship from students, room for improvement in terms of the supply of course offerings, and a strong belief in the continued growth of social entrepreneurship. The authors conclude with suggestions about the future of SEE. Design/methodology/approach: Analysis of secondary data derived from the oldest and most-frequently cited sources regarding entrepreneurship education in the USA and a novel data set examining entrepreneurship education in Canada. Both data sets were collected using an online self-report survey. Findings: Demand for SEE continues to rise in both the USA and Canada. However, course and program offerings have not kept pace. Prominent trends in social entrepreneurship such as cross-campus programs and addressing the evolving demographics of students in higher education institutions need more attention. Originality/value: A cross-cultural study of SEE that provides a high-level view of the state of the field today. In addition, the paper outlines the potential of the field of knowledge management for the future of SEE. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={This study introduces a human empowerment framework to better understand why some businesses are more socially oriented than others in their policies and activities. Building on Welzel’s theory of emancipation, we argue that human empowerment—comprised of four components: action resources, emancipative values, social movement activity, and civic entitlements—enables, motivates, and entitles individuals to pursue social goals for their businesses. Using a sample of over 15,000 entrepreneurs from 43 countries, we report strong empirical evidence for two ecological effects of the framework components on prosociality. We find that human empowerment (1) lifts entrepreneurs’ willingness to choose a social orientation for their business, and (2) reinforces the gender effect on prosociality in business activity. We discuss the human empowerment framework’s added value in understanding how modernization processes fully leverage the potential of social business activities for societies. © 2018, The Author(s).},

Using Ashoka’s portfolio of Indian social enterprises as empirical context of Western venture philanthropy investing activity, our results suggest that (a) Indian municipalities with social enterprises that have received venture philanthropy investments experience a decrease in income inequality level and (b) when these social enterprises are dominated by a collectivistic organizational identity orientation the effect is stronger. Our findings have implications for the research on hybrid organizations, financing of social entrepreneurship and grand ethical challenges. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.},

Although organizations increasingly use various social performance targets to direct their operations, the scholarly knowledge on social performance reference points remains limited. We make use of the prior accounting literature and draw on the idea of compromising accounts to discuss how provisional and performative metrics can have a significant role in how organizations develop new ways to evaluate their social performance. Given that the social performance reference point criteria are ambiguous and the corresponding referents malleable, performative accounts are helpful as they can intervene in the organizational life by making particular things visible, providing space for interpretations, and facilitating discussion, thus creating temporary settlements and enabling opportunities for productive compromises between different organizational groups and evaluative principles. The recursive feedback loops between reference point referents, criteria and accounting artefacts help the organization to make sense of its own social performance and interpret the associated performance feedback, and thereby provide ground for organizational decisions on further action. Moreover, we discuss how imperfect accounts can be useful for social businesses in their pursuit of developing their activities and achieving social impact. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Globalization has been facing a backlash. By contrast, entrepreneurship has come to be seen as a panacea for economic development and generating jobs that are perceived to be under threat from globalization. In this Perspectives paper, our central argument is that globalization and entrepreneurship must be viewed holistically, recognizing that globalization is an enabler of important entrepreneurship outcomes. We argue that networks created as a byproduct of globalization facilitate various forms of entrepreneurship. Interpersonal networks (e.g., diasporas) facilitate transnational entrepreneurship which can, in turn, reduce institutional distance between locations. Interorganizational networks (e.g., MNE-orchestrated ecosystems) facilitate technology entrepreneurship which reinforces the institutional work that gives rise to new technological domains and fields. Intergovernmental and civil society networks facilitate social entrepreneurship which helps redress institutional voids. Thus globalization can be a force for good by enabling forms of entrepreneurship that enable important institutional change. We highlight the importance of paradox thinking, which is rooted in ancient Chinese philosophy, in transcending an either/or perspective of globalization and entrepreneurship. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

Continued growth in demand from chronically food insecure consumers and criticism of the dominant food bank model of gifted food support has led to the development of ‘community supermarkets’ that charge consumers for donated food in countries including Canada, the United Kingdom, France and Italy, but not in Australia. This research investigates barriers to the development of community supermarkets in Australia through in-depth interviews with senior staff within seven organizations involved in the food relief supply chain, as well as a pilot survey of 38 food insecure consumers. The results of this research are analyzed through the lens of ‘voluntary failure’ theory and highlight systemic barriers to the reach of social enterprise as a mechanism for addressing food insecurity. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Social entrepreneurship in business education is growing in importance as a way to teach ethics and instill high ethical standards in individuals. One effective way to integrate social entrepreneurship is through experiential learning; where the participant is actively involved in processing the knowledge and developing skills, while being involved in the learning situation. MBA programs are currently beginning to incorporate social entrepreneurship into their curricula to teach their students, as well as developing students’ intercultural skills. An examination of the current trends will be followed by an analysis of how business schools can effectively incorporate social entrepreneurship into the MBA curriculum. To tie these concepts together, the paper provides a case study of a program run by Emzingo, a leadership development company, and IE Business School. The reasons for the in-depth case study are three-fold. First, it provides an example of how business schools can use experiential learning to incorporate social entrepreneurship in an international context. Second, it highlights the benefits of incorporating social entrepreneurship in MBA programs. Finally, it provides a general framework for business programs that are looking to integrate various social entrepreneurship elements in their MBA programs. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

While the BM concept is normally associated with financial objectives, socio-entrepreneurial BMs are uniquely identifiable by their social value propositions, by their intended target markets and by the projected social change. Drawing from a longitudinal case study of a Colombian foundation, we outline the characteristics of socio-entrepreneurial BMs. We analyse the entrepreneurial process behind the implementation of a BM that draws on communitarian innovative solutions that benefit the excluded and, ultimately, society at large. Focusing on the question of how socio-entrepreneurial BMs progressively evolve to produce social change, we examine the BM of a successful socio-entrepreneurial venture that exhibits the conditions of social change. Our findings show that the social value proposition, the entrepreneur’s passion for social change and a community-based network are decisive factors. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.},

Different vehicles for impact investment have emerged over the years; however, our understanding around their emergence, configuration and adoption is limited. Hence, the main purpose in this research is to study the role of the contextual drivers and conditions that gave rise to a unique form of impact investment in India, a financial social innovation–developmental venture capital (DVC). Through the lens of capital theories, insights from the case of India’s largest and oldest DVC firm along with three of its most prominent investees are presented. Findings highlight that the social entrepreneurs behind the case DVC wholly re-conceptualized silicon valley-style venture capital financing to suit small brick and mortar investments in rural India, developed mechanisms for deploying funding frugally, and created partnerships of equals between themselves and their investees. Investee founders leveraged human and social capital throughout the social innovation process via deep immersion in the socio-cultural milieu of India. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={This article uses prototypes and continuous dimensions to place social entrepreneurship in relation to other organizational forms. This approach is more fruitful than classical attempts to stipulate essential characteristics and establish boundaries. A prototype and continuous dimension approach allows consideration of the way social entrepreneurship functions similarly to and differently from related concepts, such as traditional entrepreneurship, public social services, and collectivism. These categories can be distinguished according to the degree to which control over the way value is created, allocated, and distributed occurs socially or entrepreneurially. This approach offers the additional advantage of making the concept more precise, as subdimensions clarify the relationship to practices such as volunteerism and theories such as antidevelopment. By mapping the network of organizational forms in which social entrepreneurship can be located, we can focus on the viability and advisability of different ways of solving social problems. © 2016 by The American Society for Public Administration},

abstract={Policy perspectives of the European Union as well as those of member states currently link the concepts of social investment and social entrepreneurship in order to advocate both where and howto intervene. The argument of this article is that the explicit linking of these two notions, by policy-makers at several different levels and scales of authority, constitutes an emerging policy paradigm. The article identifies three characteristics of any paradigm, including that a policy paradigm must provide a perspective on the maintenance of the well-being of both society and individuals. Despite variation across countries and levels of authority (a characteristic of any paradigm) policy communities proffer the quasi-concepts of social investment and social entrepreneurship in combination as the appropriate ways to govern financing and the delivery of social investments. Therefore, social enterprises are targeted to receive public financing in order to deliver social investments in activation (training, employability, job support and wage supplements) as well as childcare. Reliance on this assemblage is documented across scales from the local through the national, transnational and international. Copyright © Cambridge University Press 2016.},

This paper explores the sustainability and resilience of a not-for-profit firm that claims to contribute to sustainable development of the food system. We used semi-structured interviews and Holling's adaptive cycle as a heuristic device to assess what constitutes social and sustainable entrepreneurship in this case, and we discuss the determinants of organizational resilience. The business, Biodynamiska Produkter (BP), has experienced periods of growth, conservation and rapid decline in demand, followed by periods of re-organization. Our results suggest that BP, with its social mission and focus on organic food, meets the criteria of both a social and sustainability entrepreneurial organization. BP also exhibits criteria for organizational resilience: two major crises in the 1970s and late 1990s were met by re-organization (transformation) and novel market innovations (adaptations). BP has promoted the organic food sector in Sweden, but not profited from this. In this case study, resilience has enhanced sustainability in general, but trade-offs were also identified. The emphasis on trust, local identity, social objectives and slow decisions may have impeded both economic performance and new adaptations. Since the successful innovation Ekolådan in 2003, crises have been met by consolidation rather than new innovations. © 2016 by the authors.},

This paper is aimed to contribute empirical evidence on entrepreneurial ventures from Latin American emerging economies and their internationalization and value orientation. Based on the 2009 Global Entrepreneurship Monitor data, we found that institutional voids on Latin American emerging economies were a double-edge sword: on one hand, inefficient and unregulated markets make ventures from Latin American emerging economies encounter the liability of their country of origin; on the other hand, less active governments and absence of influential NGOs alternatively trigger more social entrepreneurial opportunities, with some of them across the national border. Some entrepreneurs from Latin American emerging economies have been active in exploiting those international social opportunities. International social entrepreneurship can be regarded as an alternative solution to social problems which governments, NGOs, or for-profit ventures fail to tackle on Latin American emerging economies. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

We investigated the processes by which these organizations create and implement locally situated innovative approaches to promote health and wellness. Using an inductive, qualitative approach, we identified central themes by which conversion foundations, as social entrepreneurs, developed collaborative solutions to health. We found that they defined the social problem, generated social capital in the community, and educated potential partners. These mechanisms helped build a groundwork for collaboration among community actors. Conversion foundations then convened partners with complementary competencies to develop creative solutions. This research contributes to the literature on social entrepreneurship and nonprofits by expanding understanding of how foundations can foster community collaborations to develop innovative solutions to social problems.

abstract={Purpose: To explore innovative enabler mechanisms for women's empowerment in a social enterprise and how they promote local development in a Zapotec indigenous community, the third largest ethnic group in Mexico. Originality/gap/relevance/implications: This paper contributes to the extension of social entrepreneurship literature from a gender perspective, exploring the mechanisms that allow women to succeed in highly marginalized indigenous communities. Key methodological aspects: This paper follows a case study methodology, inductive approach and qualitative methods mainly through 70 in-depth interviews. Summary of key results: Although the male-dominated culture slows down the democratic and political empowerment of women in the community, mechanisms such as job stability, low-interest microcredits and gender-equality policies in the organization have triggered economic empowerment. Key considerations/conclusions: The creation of empowering mechanisms within the social enterprise has allowed the Zapotec community to prosper and increase its general wellbeing. Women have been particularly benefited since the organization has given them the opportunity to work, empowering them to create micro-enterprises and changing the prevailing culture towards a more equalitarian society. Increasing control of their source of income has improved women's willingness to participate in political and managerial decision-making, inspiring more women in the community to work at the organization. © 2016 Mackenzie Presbyterian University.

This is also a field in which practice has moved far ahead of academia and research, which was lately noticed by the academics. This article discusses about the teaching model on social entrepreneurship developed by Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) which has pioneered many such innovative programs. The Program on social entrepreneurship has been successfully running since 2007. The paper proposes that the learning model and the process developed at TISS can be adopted by other universities and educational institutions in developing curriculum befitting to the needs of the society. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Purpose-The purpose of this paper is to propose an attributes framework for embedding "Changemaker"-a university initiative for promoting social innovation and social impact-across the disciplines at the University of Northampton. Design/methodology/approach-The study is based on the authors' (2015) phenomenographic study that proposed five different conceptions of Changemaker held by academic staff: (1) Changemaker as institutional strategy; (2) Changemaker as critical thinking, perspective shifting and problem solving; (3) Changemaker as employability; (4) Changemaker as social betterment; and (5) Changemaker as personal transformation. The present study explores pedagogic literature to identify skills, behaviours and attributes associated with each of these five categories. Findings-Findings from this literature review inform a set of Changemaker attributes, which offers a framework to consider skills and behaviours associated with the five conceptions of Changemaker. Research limitations/implications-The conceptions of Changemaker, that form the basis of the Changemaker attributes, represent the beliefs of teaching staff at the University of Northampton. Despite inherent limitations, the approach of using practice-based empirical findings to develop pedagogical tools may be of direct benefit to other education providers as they develop their own models for teaching and learning. Practical implications-The Changemaker attributes will be used by the University of Northampton during the design, approval and review of courses to ensure that social innovation and social impact is embedded across the disciplines. Academic staff can refer these attributes when designing assessments and for inspiration towards innovative teaching practice. Originality/value-The findings of this study will provide a point of reference for other higher education institutions as they look for guidance on embedding social innovation and social impact into their curriculum. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: Sweden, and many other countries, has, during the twentieth century, developed a rather large public sector providing social welfare services to citizens. Only to a small extent were private for- or nonprofit organizations providing these services. During the last decade we have seen a shift towards more services being provided by private for- and nonprofit actors. This shift means that roles are reconsidered, renegotiated and reconstructed. In this debate social entrepreneurship, social enterprises and innovation are emphasized. The aim of this paper is to problematize and analyze how social entrepreneurship and social enterprises relate to public sector management and governance. Design/methodology/approach: In the paper theories on (social) entrepreneurship and innovation is combined with theories focusing on welfare structures. Empirically, the analysis is based on the current policy development in Sweden and five social entrepreneurship initiatives. Findings: The analysis discloses the relationship between the public sector and social entrepreneurship as negotiation of emerging social enterprise markets in which aspects as the creation of value, dependencies and innovation are emphasized. Even if the study has a geographical focus both theoretical contributions and implications for policy and practice can be of use also in other contexts. Originality/value: Through combining social entrepreneurship with welfare services and public management this empirically based study contributes both to problematize and align the emerging field of social innovation. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Teacher education has become a topic for national debate and the array of alternative models and structures and those who represent them make it difficult to predict a likely outcome. Research remains inconclusive regarding directions to be pursued and the appeals to expertise and professionalism are largely ignored by policy makers and others. Traditional coalitions of supporters have fractured and there is a decided absence of political and professional support for traditional teacher education.

abstract={This study explores the relationship between an entrepreneur's age and his/her social value creation goals. Building on the lifespan developmental psychology literature and institutional theory, we hypothesize a U-shaped relationship between entrepreneurs’ age and their choice to create social value through their ventures, such that younger and older entrepreneurs create more social value with their businesses while middle age entrepreneurs are relatively more economically and less socially oriented with their ventures. We further hypothesize that the quality of a country’s formal institutions in terms of economic, social, and political freedom steepen the U-shaped relationship between entrepreneurs’ age and their choice to pursue social value creation as supportive institutional environments allow entrepreneurs to follow their age-based preferences. We confirm our predictions using multilevel mixed-effects linear regressions on a sample of over 15,000 entrepreneurs (aged between 18 and 64 years) in 45 countries from Global Entrepreneurship Monitor data. The findings are robust to several alternative specifications. Based on our findings, we discuss implications for theory and practice, and we propose future research directions. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={Research Summary: This study focuses on the dilemmas that social entrepreneurs encounter and the practices used to manage dilemmas over time. Using a multi-method approach involving event structure analysis and an inductive multiple case study, we find that four key organizational practices—asset multiplication, leveraging human capital, building social embeddedness, and affordable quality—embody the jugaad elements of frugality and inclusivity. Adding to the social entrepreneurship literature, this study demonstrates that the jugaad approach is conceptually distinct from bricolage and relevant to the study of social enterprises' resource mobilization processes. Managerial Summary: How do social enterprises encounter and manage dilemmas over time in emerging markets? The present study responds to this question, finding that social entrepreneurs mobilize resources and overcome dilemmas using the practices of jugaad, the “Indian method” of problem-solving. These jugaad practices can be used to build and allocate resources and create trade-offs among the jugaad elements of frugality and inclusivity. Based on our results, we recommend that social entrepreneurs pay close attention to how to proceduralize human assets, which would allow these entrepreneurs to build training systems that are highly task-focused and replicated across functions. We also encourage social entrepreneurs to work in rural markets and seek wider resource pools within these markets by building social embeddedness in rural communities. © 2020 The Authors.

abstract={Scaling social impact is regarded as the main currency in social enterprise and social entrepreneurship. Many social enterprises scale their social impact through ecosystem growth strategy, under which they indirectly address targeted social problems by growing and/or sustaining a supportive social enterprise ecosystem through activities such as organising advocacy campaigns and supporting other social enterprises to grow. However, the existing literature is largely biased towards the success stories of ecosystem growth strategy. Countering this “success bias”, this article presents a framework describing how, under certain conditions, scaling social impact through ecosystem growth strategy can create unintended consequences. In doing so, this paper also challenges the prevailing reductionist view of ecosystem growth as a social impact scaling strategy and provides a more reliable and comprehensive account of this scaling strategy. This article hopes to stimulate future research on greater understanding and management of unintended consequences of ecosystem growth strategy in social enterprise, as well as delineating the boundary conditions of this strategy with regard to scaling social impact. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Purpose: To explore the practice and science of social good and identify avenues for producing research and evidence-based practice in this area. The main proposition of this paper is that social good has the potential to promote ideals that directly align with social work values, offer new alliances and innovative technologies for achieving them, and spark interest in macro practice. Method: To gain an understanding of social good, a three-pronged approach was used: (a) review of multidisciplinary academic literature; (b) review of web-based information; and (c) analysis of qualitative interviews with nine social good experts. Results: The combined data indicated three social good domains: diversity and inclusion, environmental justice and sustainability, and peace and collaboration. A proposed definition and conceptual model of social good has emerged from the data: (I) social good domains; (II) unconventional systems of change; and (III) innovative technologies and approaches. Conclusions: Social good can open up new opportunities for the social work profession, together with allied disciplines, to lead the development of evidence-based practices and educational programs aimed at promoting social justice. It can bring a fresh direction to social work, rooted in the profession’s bedrock values and befitting the entrepreneurial spirit, advances and technological innovations of the 21st century. © The Author(s) 2018.},

abstract={Process models are valuable conceptual tools to help in understanding the approaches to value creation in social enterprises. This teaching case illustrates the application of a process model about creating, building, and sustaining a social enterprise with a mission to provide clean water to communities in need. The social enterprise generates revenue in support of community water projects and works with community stakeholders in different locations throughout the world to provide sustainable clean water solutions. The case study uses primary data from semi-structured interviews, direct observations of a community project, and archival sources to demonstrate application of the process model. The study shows how the social enterprise developed as a promising idea; was implemented through an operating model with resources to support social impact; and continues to build and evolve while guided by the social mission. The paper concludes with a discussion and teaching note on ways to use the case for educational purposes to enhance learning about the social value creation process. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.},

Social entrepreneurs are higher in extraversion and openness to experience, lower in managerial personality characteristics, and more driven by ideology rather than by capital gains. Social entrepreneurs also have stronger early ideological and leadership training. Multiple regression analysis reveals that a relatively robust and persistent set of internal psychological drivers prompt a search for specific experiences that are related to leadership roles and social change orientations, including social entrepreneurship and the relevant leading experiences in adolescence and young adulthood. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to discuss the commercialisation mechanisms of the innovations that emerge from the informal sector of Indian economy. Also known as grassroots innovations, they are said to better fit with the local market demands and conditions in the developing nations of the world. The paper discusses the grassroots innovation ecosystem in India and the role that is played by the state in providing institutional support. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on an exploratory study using both the primary and secondary sources of data. Primary data are taken from the interview of the innovators during the field work, whereas secondary data are acquired from research articles published in various journals indexed in Scopus and web of sciences, government publications and reports. The annual reports of National Innovation Foundation are analysed to gather information and to build the arguments for this paper. The secondary data are also collected and evaluated from the database of the grassroots innovators available on Grassroots Innovation Augmentation Network. Findings: The paper provides insight into how the grassroots innovations are commercialised in India through different pathways such as social entrepreneurship, technology transfer and open source technology. It takes four case studies to discuss the institutional support to the grassroots innovator and the challenges in the diffusion of the grassroots innovations. Research limitations/implications: Due to the chosen research approach, the results cannot be generalised on all grassroots innovations. Researchers are encouraged to conduct a survey of more grassroots innovations in order to derive generalised outputs. Practical implications: The paper includes implications for understanding the diffusion process of grassroots innovations that can be useful for all the emerging and developing nations. Originality/value: The paper fulfils an identified need to study the diffusion modes of informal sector innovations and management of grassroots innovations. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={While the literature on social scaling adopts a linear perspective in which a social enterprise first tests and validates its business model and then scales it up to other settings, this study argues that in uncertain and volatile environments, a more iterative approach may be appropriate. We develop an in-depth case study of ViaVia Travellers Cafés, a social enterprise that has successfully scaled its operations to 16 locations covering four continents. Through document analyses and twelve interviews with internal and external stakeholders, we are able to map and analyze the development process of the ViaVia Travellers Cafés, with information covering a period of more than 25 years. We find that under uncertainty, the social business model does not need to be proven before scaling it up. In fact, ViaVia Travellers had not yet developed a replicable model when scaling activities were undertaken. It regarded each new expansion as an experiment, and developed the business model's economic and social elements by learning from the portfolio of its previous experiments. Overcoming uncertainty hence involved simultaneously developing and scaling the business model. Our study introduces insights from the literature on business model development under uncertainty to the research on sustainable business models and social scaling, while contributing relevant insights for social entrepreneurs trying to scale. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Despite the rapid growth of literature on social entrepreneurship and its increasing importance for social change and sustainability, little is known about how social entrepreneurship originates in different settings. In this study, we applied a gender-based perspective to analyse the origin and development of social entrepreneurship. Focusing on female social entrepreneurs in Namibia, we investigated how relationship networks sensitised women towards opportunities for social and sustainable innovations and who particularly influenced them during this process of idea generation and realisation. Using a mixed-method approach consisting of semi-structured interviews and egocentric network analysis, we identified an opportunity recognition process that differs from that of conventional ventures. Our results show that social innovation is not, e.g., due to gate-keepers but rather a result of everyday community interaction settings. This finding challenges current theories of (social) entrepreneurship, suggesting a need to further investigate the roles of gender and the socio-economic context.

abstract={Although fair trade has grown exponentially in the U.S. in recent years, we do not have a clear understanding of why small U.S. firms choose to participate in it. To answer this question, we use a qualitative case study approach and grounded theory analysis to explore the motivations of 35 small fair trade businesses. We find that shared values (ethical, religious, or business) and the desire to help others (altruism), often triggered by a critical incident, lead social entrepreneurs to found and sustain fair trade businesses. The relationship between shared values and engagement in fair trade and the relationship between altruism and engagement in fair trade are strengthened by four motivating factors: direct relationships with producers, support for social causes, the desire for the preservation of craftsmanship, and the desire to share aesthetic products. These links are strengthened by four facilitating factors (which make fair trade engagement easier): the acquisition of business knowledge, family member involvement in the firm, assistance from faith communities, and assistance from the fair trade community. Additional analysis reveals three types of fair trade social entrepreneurs: “ethics first” (or ethical) entrepreneurs, primarily motivated by human rights and social justice concerns; “faith first” (or faithful) fair traders, motivated primarily by their religious faith; and “business first” (or benevolent) businesspeople, motivated by what they perceive to be an opportunity to build a successful business while simultaneously doing “good” and helping others. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={With voluntary sports clubs operating within competitive leisure markets and local governments responding to austerity by transferring sport facilities to community groups, such organisations are encouraged to become social enterprises. Driven by social entrepreneurs embracing ‘Robin Hood’ business models, they apparently deliver innovative solutions to social problems. Such fairytale narratives are increasingly popular in Scotland with its reputation as a ‘happening place’ for social policy innovation. Using case study material from an award-winning football social enterprise, I outline how time spent in their deprived community establishing needs and ownership aided success. Also, recruiting local youth workers, developing authentic partnerships, and creating a non-judgemental environment delivered a positive ‘ripple effect’ beyond that possible from class-blind sport provision. However, ‘win win’ rhetoric ignores stresses from meeting financial requirements and moral dilemmas from trade-offs between social and business goals. The organisation’s ‘non-establishment’ nature is partially undermined by emphasising local poverty of aspiration and the psychological thinking within Dweck’s ‘Growth Mindset’ and Duckworth’s ‘Grit’ research. The resulting focus on individual effort and learning from failure chimes with neoliberal thinking, ignoring how widening societal inequality and politics causes local problems and the need for structural changes for wider social impact. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={The level of entrepreneurship between countries differs consistently. A source of this variance lies in national culture differences. Recently, the cultural dimension “tightness” has been introduced in the literature. Tightness refers to the degree to which a nation has strong norms and a low tolerance for deviant behavior. Tightness can have a direct effect on national entrepreneurial activity. It can also moderate the strength and/or direction of the relationship between other cultural characteristics and entrepreneurship. Such moderation might explain previous studies' inconclusive findings. This study analyzes tightness's impact on new business ownership, high-growth entrepreneurship, and social entrepreneurship, using recent secondary data from 29 countries. The results show that tightness has neither a direct nor a moderating effect on entrepreneurship. Other cultural dimensions, such as individualism and uncertainty avoidance, have an impact on new business ownership, but not on high-growth entrepreneurship or social entrepreneurship. This suggests that policy makers can use formal institutions to foster high-growth entrepreneurship and social entrepreneurship – even in nations whose cultural conditions do not seem to be supportive. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The aim is to analyze, define and examine the connections between social entrepreneurship and the generation of social value, considering the concept of leakage as a measure of social value creation and distribution for the hospitality industry. The paper also proposes an exploratory-theoretical framework of policies to promote social entrepreneurship in hospitality, reduce leakage, and increase the generation of social value. Firstly, the paper concentrates on the figure of the social entrepreneur as a promoter of social value creation. Secondly, it analyzes social value creation in hospitality and its measurement. Then, the article studies and presents leakage as an instrument to monitor social value created by social entrepreneurship in hospitality. Finally, the paper proposes a wide framework of policies to enhance social value creation in hospitality, through the reduction of leakage and reinforcement of social entrepreneurship. Leakage is a useful indicator to monitor social value creation in the hospitality industry. The reduction of leakage can gauge the success of policies promoting social entrepreneurship activities which improve social value creation for the host society. The paper proposes proper and idiosyncratic measures of social value creation in hospitality. It also provides a mechanism to measure the effectiveness of the actions designed to generate social entrepreneurship and social value, at a destination and also at firm or hotel level. A complete framework of actions and policies addressed to increase social entrepreneurship and social value is also proposed. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Diarrheal disease and environmental enteropathy are serious public health concerns in low-income countries. In an effort to reduce enteric infection, researchers at the University of Virginia developed a new point-of-use (POU) water treatment technology composed of silver-impregnated porous ceramic media. The ceramic is placed in a 15 L plastic container of water in the evening and the water is ready to drink in the morning. The purpose of this study was to assess field performance and local acceptance of technology in two communities in Limpopo Province, South Africa, and one community in Dodoma Region, Tanzania. Performance was determined by coliform testing of treated water. Acceptance was determined using data from 150 household surveys and a nine-day structured observational study at a local primary school. At the primary school, 100% of treated water samples had no detectable levels of total coliform bacteria (TCB) in buckets filled by researchers. For all treated school buckets, 74% of samples achieved less than or equal to 1 CFU/100 mL and 3.2 average log reduction of TCB. Laboratory experiments with highly contaminated water diluted to lower turbidity achieved 4.2 average log reduction of TCB. Turbid water (approximately 10 NTU) only achieved 1.1 average log reduction of TCB; turbidity and organic material may have interfered with disinfection. The Tanzania primary school (deep groundwater source) had less turbid water and achieved 1.4 average log reduction of TCB; however, it did have high chloride levels that may have interfered with silver disinfection. The surveys revealed that the majority of people retrieve, store, and dispense water in ways that are compatible with the new technology. The willingness-to-pay study revealed potential customers would be willing to pay for the technology without subsidies. The results of this study indicate that this novel silver-impregnated ceramic POU water treatment technology is both effective and appropriate for use in the study communities. © 2016 by the authors.},

abstract={Despite the burgeoning research on social entrepreneurship (SE), SE strategies remain poorly understood. Drawing on extant research on the social activism and social change, empowerment and SE models, we explore, classify and validate the strategies used by 2,334 social entrepreneurs affiliated with the world's largest SE support organization, Ashoka. The results of the topic modeling of the social entrepreneurs' strategy profiles reveal that they employed a total of 39 change-making strategies that vary across resources (material versus symbolic strategies), specificity (general versus specific strategies), and mode of participation (mass versus elite participation strategies); they also vary across fields of practice and time. Finally, we identify six meta-SE strategies-a reduction from the 39 strategies-and identify four new meta-SE strategies (i.e., system reform, physical capital development, evidence-based practices, and prototyping) that have been overlooked in prior SE research. Our findings extend and deepen the research into SE strategies and offer a comprehensive model of SE strategies that advances theory, practice and policy making. © 2016 Chandra et al.

abstract={This article investigates the formation and operation of a market of informal real estate in China, referred to by the term "small property" (xiaochanquan), as their property rights are "smaller" (weaker) than those of the "big" (formal) property market. In the city of Shenzhen, which experienced exponential population growth from 300,000 to more than ten million between 1978 and 2010 as the first experimental site of China's market reforms, almost half of the buildings are small-property constructions. These illegal buildings, which lack legal titles and are concentrated in 320 intra-city villages, house most of the 8 million migrant workers in Shenzhen and are the main source of livelihood of the more than 300,000 local villagers. The underlying question is how to coordinate people's behaviors in the absence of centralized law. A problem of coordination arises when players have to combine their actions in a certain way among multiple possibilities. In other words, coordination games have multiple equilibria, and therefore the payoffs alone do not determine the behavioral outcome. Instead, the final outcome depends on the specific social settings and individual participants involved, leaving room for less concrete variables, such as history and politics, to impact individuals' choices. Nobel Laureate Thomas Schelling first observed that, in situations requiring coordination, anything that makes salient one behavioral means of coordinating tends to produce self-fulfilling expectations that then lead to the occurrence of that result. This salient solution is called a focal point. The essential idea of the focal point is that the intrinsic magnetism of particular outcomes makes them qualitatively differentiable from the continuum of possible alternatives. Set against the backdrop and context of China's market transition, this research discovers that the political, legal, and economic transition in Shenzhen made rural land development and transfer the focal point, despite its illegality. This focal point coordinates players' expectations to converge on the same equilibrium in the formation and operation of the small-property market. I model the formation of the small-property market as an Assurance Game among social entrepreneurs in Shenzhen, the demolition risk as a Hawk-Dove Game between the Shenzhen government and farmers, and contract risk as a Hawk-Dove Game between a buyer and a seller. This research enriches our understanding of market institutions by applying up-todate insights from coordination games and focal point theory. It also contributes a significant real world example to the theories of coordination games and focal points, most of which are based on laboratory experiments.},

Through a case study, this paper highlights the essential tension between livelihood and conservation, and suggests that ecotourism represents a trade-off between environmental sustainability and financial success. This trade-off would be even sharper where the involvement in ecotourism is an outcome of the pressures for generating livelihood and incomes rather than from an inherent concern for nature and its preservation. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

No matter what social entrepreneurs and other powerful intermediaries subjectively believe or hope, assuming that social entrepreneurship is always productive a priori imposes significant limits on this budding field. In order to overcome this bias it is necessary to reframe how we approach and assess social entrepreneurship impact. Drawing from the economic entrepreneurship literature, this paper outlines a multi-dimensional framework to serve as a useful and preferable starting point for assessing social entrepreneurship. We then make use of this multi-dimensional lens to look closer at the impact of one case of social entrepreneurship, the school voucher programme in Milwaukee. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={This paper explores the practices of venture philanthropy (VP). A stage model is developed from an inductive analysis of high net worth entrepreneurs who are engaged in VP. The study used a qualitative case study research strategy. Informant interviews were conducted with three main groups: the principal philanthropists, foundation philanthropy teams and leaders of investee organisations in receipt of funding. The findings suggest a model of VP with eight distinct stages including deal sourcing, relationship building, screening and information gathering, co-creation, early decision-making, circular reasoning, deal structuring, post-investment after care, disengagement and return. Comparisons with venture capital (VC), developmental VC and business angel investment are drawn and distinct similarities and differences are highlighted. This suggests that VP is a hybrid model that incorporates elements of all three types of approaches. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Scholars in the field of social entrepreneurship are challenging the researchers to produce empirical research on the social dimension of this phenomenon. Drawing on Foucault, this paper proposes the notion of 'social entrepreneurial rationality' to capture the social dimension of social entrepreneurship. The article builds on a comparative case study of three social ventures, each adopting a different rationality to bring about change in regards to the organisation of their societies along ethnicity. The first introduces micro-finance in Sweden to address long-term unemployed women of immigrant background; the second is an immigrant youth association working to promote the group's values; the third is the collective production of public art in traditional immigrant suburbs of Stockholm. Whereas the first uses an economic rationality to address ethnic inequality, the second and the third make use of discursive and community rationality, respectively. This challenges social entrepreneurship scholars to acknowledge the political mileage of social entrepreneurial rationalities toward social change. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={The different shapes taken on by social entrepreneurship in contemporary society show that social goals are integrated by commercial enterprises and commercial goals are incorporated by organisations with a social mission. Combining a social mission with commercial goals is often presented as a 'win-win' situation. In this article, we highlight the potential tensions and conflicts created by the conflicting demands and expectations when the institutional non-profit and for-profit logics meet in social entrepreneuring. From this viewpoint, social entrepreneurship is an anomaly, which seems difficult to resolve. Despite this, we often read descriptions of social entrepreneurs as heroes, which show how social entrepreneurship is glorified and part of the marketisation of society. This article sets out to present a more complex and problematic picture of practising social entrepreneurship where the obvious 'win-win' situations more often appear as 'win-lose' and sometimes even as 'lose-lose'. From a three-year ethnographic study of an emerging fair-trade enterprise, the concept of disharmony shows that dilemmas are part of everyday life in social entrepreneuring. Instead of posing insoluble conflicts, dilemmas light the way for the individual social entrepreneur. They are managed through temporary rationalisation; finding a way to integrate conflicting demands into the life of a social entrepreneur. Disharmony includes moments of identity struggle, but is also a learning process in which the social entrepreneur tries to understand the difference between what she does and what she actually achieves. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={In this paper, we review the literature on entrepreneurship and the skill sets required by entrepreneurs operating in different sectors of the economy.1 Case studies from the social enterprise literature are examined in some detail. We search for distinctions between entrepreneurship in the business and public sectors and entrepreneurship in the nonprofit sector and relate this to the variations in financial support found among nonprofit sector organizations. We conclude that third sector social entrepreneurs are likely to require a different mix of skills than business entrepreneurs. In particular, political skills broadly defined, and the ability to secure and maintain charitable support, appear to be common to successful social enterprise ventures. Hence, taking too narrow a view of social entrepreneurship and social enterprise by confining it to the traditional business model of entrepreneurship constrains the potential benefits of developing social entrepreneurship in the third sector. This implies that education of potential social entrepreneurs should be broadly construed, combining business, public and nonprofit based instruction. © 2011, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

However, we are less concerned with describing Connexions than with showing how it illustrates what we previously described as the present government's ‘experimental' approach to social policy development. As well as a speedy response, this approach encourages ‘social entrepreneurs' to deliver new services and recombine old ones to meet changing individual and group needs. The fluidity of the new arrangements encourages competition to meet these needs between the various ‘partners' involved. Similar scenarios are predicted for other public services, most immediately those in other parts of the new Learning and Skills sector that includes Connexions. This way of delivering social services is creating an extraordinarily dynamic but also extremely uncertain social policy environment. © 2002, SAGE Publications. All rights reserved.},

In addition, this study investigates perceived social support as a boundary condition between the relationship of social entrepreneurial self-efficacy and social entrepreneurial intention. Findings show that positivity and empathy positively influence social entrepreneurial self-efficacy, which subsequently positively influences social entrepreneurial intention.

abstract={Purpose: This study aims to reach academic consensus on key factors and boundaries used in defining the concepts of “social entrepreneurship” (SEsh), “social entrepreneur” (SE), and “social enterprise” (SEV). This study also explores the complex relationships among social/business enterprises, definitional categories and factors, missions, and impacts on effectiveness of practices and organizing for venture success. Design/methodology/approach: Content analysis is conducted on articles published from 1998 to 2016 in peer-reviewed academic journals in the fields of management and organization. Furthermore, 80 articles are obtained and analyzed in terms of factors and frequently used terms for unified definitions and their intertwined linkages. Findings: The unifying factors for the definitions of SEsh, SE, and SEV include primary mission and processes and resources. Strong linkages are observed between SEsh and actors, SE and characteristics, and SEV and organizational form. Results indicate that definitional categories and factors share numerous joint terms that can be used to propose unified definitions. This study identifies the effective interactions of variables among social mission, capabilities to manage resources and processes, entrepreneurial characteristics of actors, and forms of ventures in a process that provides potential for organizational sustainability and impact maximization. Research limitations/implications: This paper contributes to research by identifying clear and agreed-upon factors and traits as boundaries to propose definitions that can advance the legitimacy of social entrepreneurship as an academic field worthy of future exploration. Practical implications: The findings emphasize social mission that achieves public benefits while preventing mission drift. Economic value and choice of organizational form can advance the fulfillment of objectives and governance practices. This study also presents the key influencing factors at various stages of an entrepreneurial process to determine how these concepts interact to increase the likelihood of organizational emergence and survival. Originality/value: This work is the first to systematically review management and organizational literature on the key factors and terms that constitute the distinct definitions of SEsh, SE, and SEV and help clarify their complex relations in an entrepreneurial process. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) agreed by the United Nations are a call to action for policy-makers around the globe to tackle grand societal challenges. Sustainability start-ups can help meet some of the most pressing challenges. Regions of start-up activity are commonly referred to as entrepreneurial ecosystems (EEs), although the share of sustainability start-ups varies markedly from one EE to another. While literature on EEs is abundant, scholarly work on sustainability-oriented EEs, i.e. those with a high share of sustainability start-ups, is still relatively scarce. In particular, there is limited understanding of the reasons why some EEs have a higher share of sustainability start-ups than others. The present paper considers this gap in the literature by contrasting the EEs of Berlin and Lagos, which have very different shares of sustainability start-ups. Forty interviews conducted with founders, investors, hubs and government representatives in both EEs showed that particularly successful start-ups in an EE, so-called lighthouses, play an important role in shaping the cultural, social and material attributes of an EE. This means that the sustainability orientation of these lighthouses is instrumental in creating environments in which sustainability start-ups can flourish. Moreover, lighthouses can attract new talent and resources to a region, which further underlines their role as accelerators of an EE towards sustainability. Overall, the lighthouses are a critical factor in explaining the share of sustainability start-ups. Policy-makers can strengthen this effect by giving access to extra resources and opportunities to promising start-ups and by showcasing their success. © 2020 The Authors},

A recent article has reviewed the concept of social entrepreneurship (SE) and sport and offered suggestions for future studies. Building on this article, I suggest that there is a need for critical, sociological explorations of sport and SE, most especially for scholars within the field of sport for development and peace (SDP). In this article, a review of SE and sport is briefly provided, as well as a presentation of recent critical perspectives on SE. Drawing attention to the connections between SDP and critical studies of SE, I suggest that there is an opportunity for sociologists of SDP to further understand the complex relations and neoliberal power structures involved in SDP social change, sustainability, innovation, and donor-recipient relations that would contribute significant insights for the future of the field. © The Author(s) 2018.},

abstract={Employee-owned businesses, benefit corporations, and other efforts in sustainability entrepreneurship are responding to prevalent challenges such as climate change, economic inequalities, and unethical business behavior. Universities, however, often fall short in suciently equipping students with competencies in sustainability entrepreneurship. One reason is that none of the existing frameworks links competencies to the actual processes of entrepreneurship, from discovery to consolidation. If graduates are to successfully start and run sustainability-oriented enterprises, the real-world entrepreneurship processes should provide the main orientation for training and learning. The present study proposes such a framework. We first conducted a qualitative literature review on competencies for entrepreneurs, sustainability professionals, social entrepreneurs, and sustainability entrepreneurs. We clustered the identified competencies according to conceptual similarities. On this basis, we describe sustainability entrepreneurship competencies along the entrepreneurial process model. The result is a process-oriented and literature-based framework of sustainability entrepreneurship competencies. It is intended to be used as a general vision for students, faculty, and entrepreneurs, as well as for the design of curricula, courses, and assessments. © 2019 The Author(s).},

abstract={Purpose: This conceptual paper has two central aims: to critically analyse the potential of intersectionality theory as a means by which to understand aspects of context in entrepreneurship studies, and advocate for the value of a realist perspective and mixed methods approaches to produce better intersectional research on entrepreneurship. This paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: Highlighting context as an emerging topic within entrepreneurship literature, the paper examines how drawing upon notions of intersectionality and positionality can help to explain the social context for entrepreneurial activity and outcomes, particularly in terms of agency and resources. Findings: The paper complements and extends existing intersectional approaches to entrepreneurship studies by introducing Archer’s critical realist philosophical perspective on agency and Anthias’ positional perspective on resource access, considering the usefulness of realism and mixed methods approaches for such work, and outlining a methodologically informed potential research agenda for the area. Originality/value: The paper offers a theoretical foundation for researchers to begin systematically exploring social entrepreneurial context by accounting for the effects of overarching intersecting structures such as gender, race, and socio-economic class (amongst others), presents empirical methods through which these social-structural influences, and the degree of their impact, can be identified and analysed, and suggests a philosophically robust means of conceptualising how, in combination with agency, they influence essential aspects of entrepreneurial activity. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Despite growing literature on social entrepreneurship there is scarce research on how potentially conflicting social and economic objectives manifest on a micro-level and affect everyday management of social enterprises. Applying a strategy as practice perspective we identify sources of, and responses to, temporary and complete breakdowns in Die Bäckerei, a social enterprise that epitomizes bricolage behaviour. We find that diverging interpretations of the organization’s identity eventually result in diverging standards for evaluating performance and lead to breakdowns. We discuss why bricolage is both a source of and a solution to temporary breakdowns and show how practitioners mobilize the hybrid organizational identity as an additional and equally important practice to respond to temporary breakdowns. Furthermore, in the circumstance of complete breakdown the social enterprise has to engage in identity work finding a new situational balance between its social and economic objectives and competing logics. Finally, we show how breakdowns lead to an extension of the social enterprise’s repertoire and discuss how the combination of the social mission and bricolage behaviour enables the organization to eschew path dependency, mobilize alternative resources, and build improvisational strategy. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Objective: The purpose of this article is to evaluate the scope of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and ‘Social Value Initiatives’ (SVIs) among corporations. Nowadays, CSR provides firms with an opportunity to provide community social need through discretionary corporate practices. This article contributes to knowledge on how firms approach social and environmental sustainability while maintaining economic responsibility. Research Design & Methods: This article adopts analysis based on secondary data from UK based companies. Fifty companies’ websites and policy documents (30 commercial enterprises and 20 social enterprises) were researched to identify the patterns of practices of SVIs and factors that influence the practices among companies. Findings: The findings suggest that both social and commercial enterprises focus on the adoption of the ‘CSR’ practices based on the ‘Triple Bottom Line’ (TBL) as defined in the ‘Elkington, 1997 framework’ of economic, environmental and social sustainability. The difference is that while the ‘SVIs’ of commercial enterprises develop as an operational strategy at the later stages of the business, the ‘SVIs’ of social enterprises are embedded during the enterprise creation stage. Implications & Recommendations: Based on the findings, this article develops a conceptual ‘Social Value Initiatives’ framework which forms the domain of social value practices. We suggest that future studies should focus on adopting qualitative-ori-ented primary research to explore CSR approaches, which will capture the views of management, customers, employees and shareholders. Contribution & Value Added: Despite its limitations, this article contributes to the knowledge on CSR and social value practices among social and commercial enterprises. © 2018, Cracow University of Economics.

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to address the question of how social entrepreneurs achieve the desired impact-based model of business. Design/methodology/approach: Qualitative research design included semi-structured in-depth interviews with entrepreneurs of three Chilean Tourism B Corporations (B Corps), participant observation of the Latin American B Movement, and print, digital and social media clippings. Findings: This research unearths the practices by which entrepreneurs implement their aspirations of balancing profit and social impact obligations within their business models. Research limitations/implications: Though an intentional sample is not representative in quantitative terms, the employed research design allowed the authors to deepen the understanding of the processes which are taking place in Chile, Latin America, and on the Global scale. The authors concluded that social benefit commitment guides innovation in business models of Chilean entrepreneurs seeking to have a broader positive impact on vulnerable communities and the society at large. Practical implications: This research shows that traditional businesses have the possibility of hybridizing management, combining the necessary organization that defines its mission with social or environmental purposes. The latter is likely to open up new markets for traditional businesses. Social implications: Social entrepreneurship is the principal means for new generations of entrepreneurs to make changes in businesses and in vulnerable local communities through global aspirations. But the need for more open political discussion within the B Movement is clear, especially regarding the nexus between the “negative externalities” of the traditional economy and social or environmental problems which the B Corps intend to solve. Such debate would allow companies and the movement to more easily identify new courses of action. Originality/value: This study gives account of regional nuances of social entrepreneurship and social innovation phenomena. In particular, there has been a surge of impact-oriented rather than profit-oriented innovation initiatives in neoliberal-oriented Latin American states, such as Chile. These initiatives offer us a wealth of empirical information about the development of alternative business models. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Although scholars and practitioners in the field of public administration have investigated the nature of social enterprises emerging from the nonprofit sector, little research has been undertaken on the role of governments in facilitating prospective social enterprises to transform nonprofits into social enterprises. This research explores the global phenomenon of social entrepreneurship by analysing the government-driven social enterprise programs in South Korea. What is the government-driven social enterprise policy in South Korea? What is the role of the government in driving the success of the social enterprises in South Korea? What are the factors that affect the success of government-driven social enterprises? The results of this study highlight how government support helps nonprofit organizations cope effectively with diverse constraints that may cause nonprofit failure in societies like South Korea. The study findings confirm that Salamon's third-party government perspective and nonprofit failure theory justify government intervention, suggesting that governments may drive nonprofit organizations efficiently to overcome a propensity to failure by providing them with resources. Points for practitioners: This study found that government support to the small nonprofit organizations may facilitate civil society growth in Eastern Asia countries. Our research of government-driven social enterprise policy in Seoul Korea will provide a policy model for policy decision-makers for program design that would expand social services provided by non-state actors, and government-driven nonprofit policies will allow public agencies to direct and expand the social services without creating new agencies. However, we also found that the mandatory administrative approach may not address nonprofits’ daily challenges in an effective manner. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.},

It is the result of a longitudinal study (January 2012 to September 2015). The study contributes new insights to the theoretical and methodological discussions on SE, focusing on ‘the social’ in SE literature. The three selected movements, active in the Netherlands, are: ‘The Dutch Chapter of Zeitgeist’ henceforth Zeitgeist (TZM), (2010–present), ‘Giving is All we Have’ (henceforth GIAWH, (2011–2014) and ‘MasterPeace’ (MP) (2010–present). Each movement shows a strong inclination towards social transformation, while being rooted in organizational structures, therefore considered ‘social entrepreneurial movements’. Specific contributions entail: the presentation of these innovative cases, the design of a methodology based on critical discourse analysis, state theory, narrative analysis, political theory and discourse theory and a thorough analysis and interpretation of these cases in the national and global contexts in which they emerged. More specifically, it contributes to SE literature on emancipation, defined as ‘breaking free’ when further developing the method in the direction of world-making, defined as ‘creating new worlds’. This study suggests that transition theory can be useful for the study of the impact of social entrepreneurial movements. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={The central contribution of this chapter consists in exploring the implications of a memetic perspective for dealing with complexity in (social) entrepreneurship. The line of argument can basically be divided into four aspects. First, it is argued that memes, especially their mental representations, can be conceptualized in the context of (cultural) schemata that have an impact on the perception and discovery of entrepreneurial opportunities. Second, a memetic view of creativity also suggests that opportunity creation strongly depends on memes. Third, viewing social entrepreneurship as a meme(plex) allows us to compare it with related concepts. Moreover, we argue that by focusing on the properties of social entrepreneurial opportunities we can get to the core of the social entrepreneurial process. In this chapter, we are focusing on social entrepreneurial opportunities that can be understood as the intersection of the set of ‘opportunities to solve a societal problem’ and the set of ‘profitable business opportunities’. This conception represents the vantage point for the fourth part of this contribution, where we argue that, in order to facilitate the propagation of the social entrepreneurship meme within (for-profit) organizations, a systematic analysis of the firm’s social network as well as its memeplex is advisable. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

Utilizing quantitative data on 270 social and environmental enterprises operating in Eastern and Southern Africa, some key characteristics of these kinds of enterprises are identified. These characteristics are reflected upon through a contextual lens contributing to wider debates about the nature of social and environmental entrepreneurship and enterprises in Africa. Drawing upon notions of hybridity, and sustainability oriented entrepreneurship, consideration is furthermore given to the convergence of social and environmental goals in these kinds of businesses, and in wider social and environmental innovation in Africa. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={Reaching vulnerable populations in low-resource settings with effective business solutions is critical, given the global nature of food and nutrition security. Over a third of deaths of children under 5 years of age are directly or indirectly caused by undernutrition. The Lancet series on malnutrition (2013) estimates that over 220,000 lives of children under 5 years of age can be saved through the implementation of an infant and young child feeding and care package. A unique project being undertaken in Ghana aims to bring in two elements of innovation in infant and young child feeding. The first involves a public-private partnership (PPP) to develop and test the efficacy and effectiveness of the delivery of a low-cost complementary food supplement in Ghana called KOKO Plus™. The second involves the testing of the concepts of social entrepreneurship and social business models in the distribution and delivery of the product. This paper shares information on the ongoing activities in the testing of concepts of PPPs, social business, social marketing, and demand creation using different delivery platforms to achieve optimal nutrition in Ghanaian infants and young children in the first 2 years of life. It also focuses on outlining the concept of using PPP and base-of-the-pyramid approaches toward achieving nutrition objectives. © 2014 New York Academy of Sciences.},

Based on a review of the academic debate, we discuss the requirements for such a framework. We then develop a conceptual framework that focuses on the entrepreneur- environment interaction in two dimensions. The first dimension suggests we think of social space in terms of ideas, structures, and practices. The second dimension captures the dynamic nature of social change. It looks at the interdependencies between entrepreneurs and their environment as they play out at the levels of ideas, structures, and practices over time. We apply this framework to a real-life case and discuss how it may guide case study research. Copyright © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={A relatively recent domain of academic inquiry, social entrepreneurship (SE) has been regarded as a field that transcends the boundaries of academic disciplines (Dacin et al., 2010; Mair and Marti, 2006; Seelos and Mair, 2005). However, while the basic premise to combine financial and social impact has attracted a lot of goodwill from governments, businesses, NGOs, and educational institutions alike, the development of explanatory constructs is still limited (Grimes and Victor, 2009; Hull, 2010). While social entrepreneurs are socially embedded in their local communities and assumed to show the ability to build and maintain networks in order to be able to perform (Alvord et al., 2004; Dacin et al., 2011; Mair and Marti, 2006; Perrini and Vurro, 2006), there has been a lack of theoretical foundation with respect to the surrounding network dynamics. We will argue that integrating social capital/networks approaches into the literature will enhance the academic and practical impact of our approaches, and further advance the field.

However, such encouragement raises important citizenship questions concerning the participation of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). As an innovative strategy for addressing pressing social and economic problems, "social entrepreneurship"has become a phrase that is gaining momentum in the IDD community-one that carries with it a very distinct history. Although social entrepreneurship holds the potential to be an empowering source of job creation and social innovation, it also has the potential to be used to further disenfranchise this marginalized population. It is crucial that in moving forward society takes care not to perpetuate existing models of oppression, particularly in regard to the social and economic participation of people with IDD. The conceptual tools addressed in this article can inform the way that researchers, policymakers, and practitioners approach complex issues, such as social entrepreneurship, to improve communication among disciplines while retaining an integral focus on rights and social justice by framing this issue within citizenship theory ©AAIDD.},

We frame the analysis with theory that explains why microfinance institutions serving lower-income communities charge high interest rates, face high costs, monitor customers relatively intensively, and have limited ability to lever assets.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper examines four cases of social entrepreneurship in the start-up phase. Each case is studied in real time, for a period of two years. Findings: The empirical research reveals that partnership creation for social enterprises between a social enterprise and organizations in various sectors is inhibited by conflicting interests and diverging speed of on one hand and by the conflicts that originate from the opportunity-seeking behavior of the social entrepreneur and the risk avoiding behavior of the organizations. While the social start-ups that managed to neutralize such inhibitors succeeded, the start-up enterprises that did not manage to do so failed. Originality/value: While, there is a sound body of knowledge of the factors that inhibit the more traditional single and cross-sector partnerships, relatively little is known about the factors that inhibit the partnerships between social enterprises and organizations in the business, public, government, and non-profit sectors in society. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={This bibliography is an attempt to list the most relevant material on the topic of 'social entrepreneurship' published within the past two decades. The Academic Search Complete and Web of Science databases were used to conduct a literature search using the keywords 'social enterprise', 'social entrepreneurship' and 'social entrepreneur'. The literature search was limited to peer-reviewed journal articles and books published between 1989 and 2009. Since academic interest in social entrepreneurship is a relatively new phenomenon, very little research in this area was conducted before 1989. Two seminal pre-1989 articles were included in this list: Banks (1972), who first coined the term 'social entrepreneur' in the context of the sociology of social movements; and Drucker (1979), who first introduced the concept of 'social enterprise' while advocating ethical responsibilities of corporations. Only articles and books in which 'social entrepreneurship', 'social enterprises' or 'social entrepreneurs' were the main focus and had an important role in either the formulation of an empirical study or the development of a conceptual framework were included in this list. Articles that merely mentioned these terms or in which these concepts did not play a major role were not included. Mention may be made of online resources, such as technical reports, unpublished manuscripts, conference papers and white papers. All but two such articles, Dees (2001) and Alter (2004), were excluded from this list. The artcile by Dees (2001) titled, 'The meaning of "social entrepreneurship"', is a significant conceptual contribution to the field and has been cited 211 times since its publication online. Alter's article (2004) that presents a typology of social enterprises is yet another important theoretical contribution and has been cited 35 times since it was published online. It is hoped that this systematic and thorough listing of relevant work in the area of social entrepreneurship will be of assistance to scholars in a field in which the literature, to date, has been fragmented and disjointed. It will be much appreciated if the unintentional omission of any relevant articles and books is brought to the attention of the author.},

abstract={The development of commercial revenue streams allows traditional nonprofit organizations to increase financial certainty in response to the reduction of traditional funding sources and increased competition. In order to capture commercial revenue-generating opportunities, traditional nonprofit organizations need to deliberately transform themselves into social enterprises. Through the theoretical lens of institutional entrepreneurship, we explore the institutional work that supports this transformation by analyzing field interviews with 64 institutional entrepreneurs from UK-based social enterprises. We find that the route to incorporate commercial processes and convert traditional nonprofit organizations into social enterprises requires six distinct kinds of institutional work at three different domains; these are—“engaging commercial revenue strategies”, “creating a professionalized organizational form”, and “legitimating a socio-commercial business model”. In elaborating on social entrepreneurship research and practice, we offer a comprehensive framework delineating the key practices contributing to the transformation from traditional nonprofit organizations to social enterprises. This extends our understanding of the ex-ante strategy of incorporating commercial processes within social organizations. Furthermore, the identification of these practices also offers an important tool for scholars in this field to examine the connection (or disconnection) of each practice with different ethical concerns of social entrepreneurship in greater depth. © 2020, The Author(s).},

This study of 308 industrial industry firms from Austria and Northern Macedonia contributes to closing these research gaps by investigating how SEO influences social entrepreneurial performance taking into account the performance consequences of heterogeneity in firms' characteristics demonstrated by start-ups and established firms using multi-group structural equation modeling and fsQCA as methods of comparison. Combining person-centered and variable-centered methods, this study contributes by exploring how SEO influences social entrepreneurial performance and considering firms' characteristics for both start-ups and established industrial firms. The study highlights key differences for start-ups and established firms. The development phase of a firm, thus, plays a key role when examining SEO dimensions. This study informs practices of individuals seeking to undertake a business start-up or owner/managers involved in the operation and management of established firms in a social entrepreneurship context. The findings will be of interest to the enterprise support community in tailoring funding and training support for social enterprises for both start-ups and established firms. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The entrepreneurial orientation and social role of sports clubs have recently become topics of great interest to academics and professionals. The aim of this study is to analyse the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation (EO) in sports clubs and their social performance (SP) and the effect that management variables such as the type of funding (public vs private) and the competition level (national vs regional) may have on this relationship. To compare the results, two complementary methodologies have been used to compare the results: linear models with moderation analysis and models based on qualitative comparative analysis (QCA). The study was carried out with a sample of 407 Spanish sports clubs. The instrument used to measure EO was an adaptation of the original Covin and Slevin (1989) approach, while the instrument used to measure SP is a validated scale of our own elaboration presenting good psychometric properties. The results found show a direct effect of the EO dimensions on the SP. In all cases, clubs with major public funding showed higher levels of prediction in SP. On the other hand, as far as QCA is concerned, no necessary condition was found, while the most important condition sufficient to obtain high levels of SP would be high levels of innovation, a high level of risk-taking, and low levels of proactivity in national sports clubs. In general, models based on qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) provide higher predictive values than linear regression models and include variables not considered in linear models. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

Yet it also largely expects this ambiguity to be either temporary, or else detrimental to the survival and evolution of the category. In this study, we demonstrate and explain how, alternatively, category ambiguity can persist when multiple frames continue to be applied to a category as it progresses into maturity. Drawing on an in-depth qualitative study of the case of social entrepreneurship, we examine how and under what conditions this outcome occurs. We specify two co-occurring conditions that prompt category stakeholders to shift their framing from exclusive to inclusive, enabling category ambiguity to persist. We furthermore show how the use of category frames that draw from pre-existing resonant categories supports the persistence of category ambiguity. We contribute to literature on categories by clarifying the antecedents of category evolution towards a trajectory of persistent ambiguity. © The Author(s) 2020.},

Yet little is known about how tourism-based social enterprises (TSEs) engage with local communities. This article aims to fill this void by addressing the question of what approaches to community engagement in tourism development are being encouraged by social entrepreneurship. The study focuses on TSE-led tourism initiatives in Cambodia where tourism is a key revenue sector. Based on case-study methodology, this article develops a typology of three distinct manifestations of TSEs showing varying levels of community engagement: (1) the cash cow, (2) community empowerment and (3) inclusive business model. The findings demonstrate that across the three models, TSEs contribute to new ways of ensuring that the poorest segments of society receive a greater share of benefits. This typology also captures the diversification of community engagement away from the established role of NGOs to a variety of independent social enterprises. However, due to fluctuations in tourist arrivals and lack of structural support for TSEs, it remains to be seen whether this transformation will advance the sustainable development of Cambodian communities. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={For years, research in social entrepreneurship (SE) has been dominated by theoretical papers and case studies. However, recently, the number of empirical papers on antecedents of SE-intention increased with the underlying models being either adapted from general entrepreneurship or specifically developed for the SE-context. Despite these models postulating different mechanisms of SE-intention formation it remains unclear whether there is one best-suited model for SE-intention prediction or each model features relevant mechanisms contributing to the intention formation process. In order to shed light on this, the current study investigates (i) the mechanisms impacting an individual’s SE-intention formation and (ii) the empirical suitability of the most frequently utilized SE-intention models by Ajzen (1991), Heuer and Liñán (2013), Mair and Noboa (2006) and Hockerts (2017). Structural equation modelling was applied to investigate direct and indirect effects on SE-intention as postulated in the above-mentioned models on the basis of a German sample (N = 355). Subsequently, a χ2-Difference test was used to compare the models. It was found that (i) direct and indirect effects on SE-intention exist and (ii) the models by Ajzen and Mair and Noboa showed a better empirical fit than the models by Heuer and Liñán and Hockerts, respectively. This is remarkable as the former two models only postulate direct effects whereas the latter two also include indirect effects. Notwithstanding acknowledgeable limitations, the current study provides valuable insights and avenues for future research and points out the potential educational benefits of enriching SE-course syllabi with psychological contents. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

We longitudinally examine the multi-level processes of legitimation in a transnational social enterprise operated by Ghanaian migrants across Italy and Ghana. We analyze secondary and ethnographic data for two years, observing how transnational social enterprises harvest moral and pragmatic legitimacy from the institutional contexts in which they operate. We study how entrepreneurs construe their social status through pragmatic legitimacy obtained from their transnational ventures, and their institutional environments inspired by micro- and meso legitimacy reconfigurations. We discuss theoretical implications for social and transnational entrepreneurship and practical contributions for policy-making. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Social entrepreneurship can be represented as a transitional vehicle that serves for creating shared value among an entrepreneur, society and the environment. Social entrepreneurship is a sub-discipline within entrepreneurship that remains a poorly-understood complex phenomenon. Fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) was used to empirically analyze the complex relationships among a set of capabilities (namely mission-driven, stakeholder, cross-sector collaboration and environmental management) and social entrepreneurship. Their relationships and effects on the shared value in social, environmental and economic dimensions were analyzed based on data from 22 social enterprises in Thailand. Findings show that there was no single condition that necessarily and solely contributed to high or low social entrepreneurship and shared value. However, a sufficiency analysis revealed several combinations of conditions that sufficiently produced high and low expected outcomes. Because of the special characteristics of social entrepreneurship, the findings highlight the importance of fsQCA for finding different combinations of conditions leading to the same outcomes. In addition, the social and environmental values were found to be a source of competitive advantage and superior economic value that enable the identification and creation of new market opportunities. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Purpose: Impact investing denominates an investment logic that combines social and environmental goals, financial returns as well as personal values. The purpose of this paper is to consider the concept of legitimacy to be an appropriate way to understand how actors in the impact investing market influence discourse in order to overcome the inherent liability of newness – based on hybrid institutional logics – through their financial and non-financial communication. Design/methodology/approach: Based on two theoretically defined sets of codes, a thematic discourse analysis is conducted by analysing meaningful units derived from documents produced by case-selected actors in the impact investing industry, which are then categorised into rhetorical strategies for legitimacy building. Findings: The paper finds that actors use diverse legitimisation strategies based on their relative positioning in the impact investing market. These strategies determine the actors’ main discursive foci and, in turn, are affected by the overall organisational activities, governance and mission. This study proposes and discusses eight legitimacy creating strategies of relevant archetypes of impact investing actors in their financial and non-financial communication. Following these interconnected discursive engagements, a communication gap can be demonstrated between investors, intermediaries and social entrepreneurs. Originality/value: Such discursive engagement gaps can provide a theoretical lens to explain the almost non-functional market and, as practical implications, show the need for convergence and harmonisation in financial and non-financial reports and communiques. This research further contributes to theory by providing insights into the discursive creation of legitimacy, and by promoting a better understanding of the emerging field of impact investing. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={This paper analyzes social entrepreneurship networks (SENs)–composed of social entrepreneurs, business and political elites, and international actors–in Jordan and Morocco and how they foster processes of authoritarian renewal through neoliberal forms of co-optation. I argue that these new neoliberal networks and pre-existing patterns of social interaction complement each other, fostering linkages between well-established elites and hand-picked social entrepreneurs as well as societal groups. The two case studies illustrate different trajectories of the development of SENs and their embeddedness in the respective political, social and economic contexts. Importantly, such trajectories indicate a similar direction of travel: social entrepreneurship, rather than acting as a driver of progressive change, has been aligned with the authoritarian regimes and cements neoliberalism as a mode of governance. This mutation of neoliberal tactics towards more inclusionary and consensual patterns seeks to ensure the survival of both neoliberalism and of authoritarian governance. Thus, the article brings to light repertoires of authoritarian neoliberalism that have hitherto been under-studied. Moreover, it offers a critical perspective on social entrepreneurship as an increasingly popular phenomenon that, in academia and beyond, has all too often been approached from an uncritical and apolitical perspective. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Findings showed that for all respondents, the relationship of SEI with agreeableness are mediated by empathy, self-efficacy and perceived social support. Self-efficacy and social support mediated grit and SEI. To determine the difference between the drivers of SEI among senior high school and early college students, multigroup analysis was conducted.

abstract={Abstract: In the aftermath of the Great Recession, the concern with exclusionary and unethical business practices has led to the growing popularity of social entrepreneurship, which focuses on the creation of social value, not wealth. In this article, I reflect on social entrepreneurship in China, a unique context given the strong communist party leadership and the transition to a market economy. To begin, I discuss the legal and political framework for social entrepreneurship in China, followed by an overview of the sector’s characteristics, including age, size, social issues emphasized, leader characteristics, and the role of women. Next, I provide examples of three social enterprises in China that illustrate the diverse possibilities for this sector as a force for social and institutional change. I conclude with some suggestions for strengthening China’s social enterprise ecosystem. © 2018, © 2018, Journal of Economic Issues / Association for Evolutionary Economics.},

abstract={Background: Mobile health (mHealth) offers a promising solution to the multitude of challenges the Vietnamese health system faces, but there is a scarcity of published information on mHealth in Vietnam. Objective: The objectives of this scoping study were (1) to summarize the extent, range, and nature of mHealth initiatives in Vietnam and (2) to examine the opportunities and threats of mHealth utilization in the Vietnamese context. Methods: This scoping study systematically identified and extracted relevant information from 20 past and current mHealth initiatives in Vietnam. The study includes multimodal information sources, including published literature, gray literature (ie, government reports and unpublished literature), conference presentations, Web-based documents, and key informant interviews. Results: We extracted information from 27 records from the electronic search and conducted 14 key informant interviews, allowing us to identify 20 mHealth initiatives in Vietnam. Most of the initiatives were primarily funded by external donors (n=15), while other initiatives were government funded (n=1) or self-funded (n=4). A majority of the initiatives targeted vulnerable and hard-to-reach populations (n=11), aimed to prevent the occurrence of disease (n=12), and used text messaging (short message service, SMS) as part of their intervention (n=14). The study revealed that Vietnamese mHealth implementation has been challenged by factors including features unique to the Vietnamese language (n=4) and sociocultural factors (n=3). Conclusions: The largest threats to the popularity of mHealth initiatives are the absence of government policy, lack of government interest, heavy dependence on foreign funding, and lack of technological infrastructure. Finally, while current mHealth initiatives have already demonstrated promising opportunities for alternative models of funding, such as social entrepreneurship or private business models, sustainable mHealth initiatives outside of those funded by external donors have not yet been undertaken. © Jeffrey A Lam, Linh Thuy Dang, Ngoc Tran Phan, Hue Thi Trinh, Nguyen Cong Vu, Cuong Kieu Nguyen.},

abstract={Remote coastal communities often lack direct exposure to tourism activities, resulting in low levels of awareness of tourism. Low levels of awareness and limited understanding of tourism may nullify meaningful participation in widely advocated tourism planning and development strategies, such as community-based tourism (CBT). This paper presents data from a research project that sought to explore the viability of tourism as a development strategy for remote fishing communities in the Philippines. Interviews revealed that awareness of tourism within two remote coastal communities in the Philippines was minimal. These results indicate the limited potential for effective and meaningful participation by locals in tourism development planning as called for by the CBT strategy. Thus, the discussion focuses on theoretical and alternative approaches to tourism development when tourism awareness levels are lacking. As a consequence, a new approach, the Social Entrepreneurship Tourism Model, is proposed, to address the shortcomings of CBT for remote fishing communities with low tourism awareness levels as defined by this study. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Purpose – The purposes of this chapter are to propose definitions of innovation, product innovation, business model innovation, marketing innovation, innovation strategy, and strategic innovation, elaborate on their literature and conceptual underpinnings, and provide an overview of the conceptual domains of innovation, innovation strategy, and strategic innovation. Methodology/Approach – First, certain definitions of innovation, drawn from literature, are presented. Next, certain definitions that incorporate logically incremental refinements in them are presented. Building on these, definitions of innovation, product innovation, business model innovation, and marketing innovation are proposed. Findings – Innovation is the creation of value by using relevant knowledge and resources for conversion of an idea into a new product, process, or practice, or improvements in an existing product, process, or practice. Innovation strategy is an organization’s relative emphasis on different types of innovations and the associated pattern of resource allocation, in alignment with its strategy at the corporate and business unit levels. Strategic innovation is the creation of value by using relevant knowledge and resources for conversion of an idea into a new product, process, or practice with the potential to have a major transformational effect on the evolution of markets and industries. Practical implications – Over the past several decades, there has been a sustained and high level of interest in issues relating to innovation among academics in a number of disciplines, business and social entrepreneurs, business practitioners, and policy makers. Books, journal articles, and business magazine articles provide a number of definitions of innovation and specific types of innovation. Multiple definitions of a construct can be problematic in certain respects and beneficial in other respects. A potential upside of multiple definitions of innovation is the prospect of each being a source of ideas for one or more innovations that benefit society, and an impetus for research focusing on specific questions. Originality/value – Implementation of an idea, value creation, and use of relevant knowledge and resources are used as constituent elements in the proposed definitions of innovation, product innovation, business model innovation, marketing innovation, and strategic innovation. © 2018 by Emerald Publishing Limited All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.},

abstract={Purpose: This paper aims to explore the potential agency of university-based social entrepreneurship ecosystems (U-BSEEs) from a political ecology perspective. It addresses how higher education institutions can leverage their embedded role within a community to foster social entrepreneurship, by leveraging adult learning theories of andragogy and heutagogy in (social) entrepreneurship education. Design/methodology/approach: This empirical study interviewed ten senior-level academics in the USA, the UK, Ireland and Australia with practical experience in the (social) entrepreneurship and social innovation space. Qualitative methods of structured interviews, coding and analysis were used as an appropriate procedure to examine the political ecology of U-BSEEs and the interconnectedness of its actors. Findings: Key findings included criticisms of higher educations’ role in society; financial resources and university impact on stakeholders; the potential of student-based initiatives and programs leveraging andragogy and ideally heutagogy adult learning theories; and changes universities could implement to become key actors of U-BSEEs. Student engagement and cross-disciplinary work is apparently the modus operandi to successful university based ecosystem development. Research limitations/implications: Research limitations included sample size and lack of junior and mid-level academic perspectives; surveys could be conducted in future research on the topic to generate quantitative data to strengthen findings. Implications of the research suggest that universities possess the necessary resources and personnel to serve as keystone actors of an ecosystem, but currently do not leverage the expertise available to them. Practical implications: All respondents concurred that focusing on students as change agents, and building social entrepreneurship education programs could foster a trophic cascade of increased collaboration, economic growth, political capital and social good in the local and regional ecosystem. Originality/value: This study is original in its attempt to build on the entrepreneurship ecosystem literature by considering the agency of U-BSEEs from a political ecology lens. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={This paper seeks to contribute to understanding of the factors associated with an effective emergent emergency response organisation and to provide new insights into this understudied area. It examines, through an analysis of a range of textual resources, the emergence and re-emergence of the Student Volunteer Army (SVA) during the devastating earthquakes in Canterbury, New Zealand, in 2010–11. This evaluation is conducted in relation to the four key features of an effective emergency response organisation: adaptability; direction; leadership; and communication. In addition, the paper aims to further understanding of ‘emergency entrepreneurship’ and thus of the values and strategies that underpin social entrepreneur organisations in times of normalcy. The paper concludes that the unique position of the SVA as a ‘repeat emergent’ emergency response organisation enabled it to innovate continually and to improve repeatedly its systems, relationships, and image, such that it exhibited features common to emergent and established emergency response organisations. © 2017 The Author(s).

This study reviewed empirical data to determine how the imaginative capacities of potential entrepreneurs affect their perceived success in operating agrisocio enterprises. The reliability and validity, and the direct and interactive effects among different imaginative capacities were analysed. The study indicated that although conceiving and transforming imagination were positively related to all the dimensions of perceived performance, initiating imagination was negatively related to the dimensions of business operations and service programmes. Some interactions among the three types of imagination were also found. This study contributes to the social entrepreneurship literature by theorising and testing how imaginative capacities can be beneficial to potential entrants for perceiving business success. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Background: Diarrheal disease is a major cause of mortality and morbidity in low and middle income countries with children being disproportionately affected. Project SHINE (Sanitation & Hygiene INnovation in Education) is a grassroots participatory science education and social entrepreneurship model to engage youth and the wider community in the development of sustainable strategies to improve sanitation and hygiene. Methods: Based in rural and remote Tanzania, this pilot study engaged pastoralist high-school students and communities in the development and evaluation of culturally and contextually relevant strategies to improve sanitation and hygiene. Using a train-the-trainer approach, key activities included teacher workshops, school-based lessons, extra-curricular activities, community events and a One Health sanitation science fair which showcased projects related to water, sanitation and hygiene in relation to human and animal health. The process and outcome of the study were evaluated through qualitative interviews and focus group discussions with diverse project participants, as well as pre- and post- questionnaires completed by students on knowledge, attitudes and practices concerning sanitation and hygiene. Results: The questionnaire results at baseline and follow-up showed statistically significant improvements on key measures including a decrease in unhygienic behaviors, an increase in the perceived importance of handwashing and intention to use the toilet, and increased communication in the social network about the importance of clean water and improved sanitation and hygiene practices, however there were no significant changes in sanitation related knowledge. Qualitative data highlighted strong leadership emerging from youth and enthusiasm from teachers and students concerning the overall approach in the project, including the use of participatory methods. There was a high degree of community engagement with hundreds of community members participating in school-based events. Sanitation science fair projects addressed a range of pastoralist questions and concerns regarding the relationship between water, sanitation and hygiene. Several projects, such as making soap from local materials, demonstrate potential as a sustainable strategy to improve health and livelihoods in the long-term. Conclusions: The Project SHINE model shows promise as an innovative capacity building approach and as an engagement and empowerment strategy for youth and communities to develop locally sustainable strategies to improve sanitation and hygiene. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={The intent of this research is to propose and analyse a set of policies in the construction industry to enhance social development. First, the paper shows the connections between the development of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and social entrepreneurship (SE), the reduction of the leakage, and then the generation of social value (SV) for sustainable regional development. For that, the article analyses briefly the literatures on SE and leakage, and focuses on the relevance of SME and social entrepreneurs as promoters of SV creation and development. Second, the paper proposes a framework and proposes a set of 20 policies aimed to reduce leakage, reinforce SMEs and entrepreneurship and also to promote SE behaviour by the diverse economic agents in the construction industry, in order to increase the generation of SV and sustainable development. Then, the paper analyses the acceptability, feasibility and viability of these proposed polices, which can be useful for academics and practitioners. For that, the study uses the Delphi methodology, applied to an expert-group of 23 professionals (representatives of the private and public sector) belonging to the Colombian construction industry. The results emphasize the relevance of the development of local incumbents and the social focus of firms to increase the generation of SV. Oppositely, policies interfering economic freedom and free trade receive the lowest rates in the three criteria considered. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

In contrast to other prominent approaches to ethics, virtue ethics provides a useful perspective in making sense of various business ethics issues with an emphasis on the moral character of the individuals and its transformational influences in driving ethical business conduct. Building on Geoff Moore’s (Bus Ethics Q 12(1):19–32, 2002; Bus Ethics Q 15(2):237–255, 2005; Bus Ethics Q 18(4):483–511, 2008) treatment of Alasdair MacIntyre’s practice–institution schema, the paper discusses how individuals, as moral agents, can serve to promote virtuous business conduct and help foster a moral and ethical climate in the organization and in society at large. Using interview data from a broader study of the New Zealand wine industry as explanatory examples, the paper argues that while many companies’ sustainable practices are still largely market based, such excellent business practices are often driven by individuals’ moral and ethical pursuits. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={In recent years, social entrepreneurs in the third sector have played an increasingly important role in addressing societal problems. Despite their growing presence in civic society, little is known about how social entrepreneurs obtain the necessary skills, knowledge, and motivation to take on this role. This exploratory study empirically addresses this gap through 27 in-depth case studies of social entrepreneurial leaders of third-sector initiatives in Brazil. Findings show that the social entrepreneurs relied on a convergence of experiences including: direct experience with inequality, interaction with target populations, volunteer work, religious institutions, social activism, formal education, professional experience, reading, and intercultural interactions. The study also presents a nuanced understanding of how the interplay among life experiences and learning processes informed these third-sector leaders. Results are relevant to scholars and practitioners committed to fostering social entrepreneurship in the third sector. © 2015, International Society for Third-Sector Research and The Johns Hopkins University.},

abstract={Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to shed light on the international market expansion of multinational corporations (MNCs) to the base of the pyramid (BoP). The authors employ the corporate social entrepreneurship (CSE) perspective to reveal how MNCs can enter this market, the key enabling factors and the benefits they can gain. CSE is related to entrepreneurial and marketing strategies that are inspired by social responsibility. Design/methodology/approach – An exploratory, qualitative multiple-case study has been employed. In-depth interviews were conducted with managers from three MNCs that have entered the BoP market in India. Findings – The findings of this research confirm that successful entry into the BoP requires the pursuit of social responsibility and the adaptation of marketing strategies. In addition, MNCs should identify the key environmental factors (demand conditions and socio-political actors’ expectations) and develop organisational characteristics (management support, network orientation towards non-governmental organisations and availability of financial resources) to match. The findings of this research show that engagement in CSE in countries with considerable BoP populations can bring firms legitimacy and sustainable profitability. Research limitations/implications – This research is based on interviews with a limited number of MNCs in India. Future studies could generalise the findings of this research to a larger number of corporations in other countries. Originality/value – This research brings new insights to the field of international marketing by integrating the corporate social responsibility, marketing and entrepreneurship disciplines. The findings of this research offer empirical support for CSE and its role in international marketing strategies. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={PurposeThis paper aims to utilize a framework from classic sociology – Max Weber’s Typology of Rationality – to understand the motivations for social entrepreneurship in responsible tourism in India. The critical role of the social entrepreneur in effecting the phenomenon of social entrepreneurship has been largely under-recognized. The authors seek to explore, develop and enhance Weber’s theoretical arguments in the context of the tourism industry. Design/methodology/approachThe authors used a constructivism paradigm and Seidman’s (2006) Three Interview Series technique to obtain the narratives of two social entrepreneurs in India. Data were analyzed using a hybrid thematic coding procedure. FindingsFindings indicate that there exists a dynamic interplay between the formal and substantive rationalities that underlie the behavior of social entrepreneurs. The authors also discuss how entrepreneurs draw upon their formal and substantive repertoires to create their identities through the simultaneous processes of apposition (“Me”) and opposition (“Not Me”). Practical implicationsThe findings provide an important recognition of the impact of formal and substantive rationalities on the conceptualization, implementation and manifestation of social enterprise for a variety of stakeholders. Originality/valueThis paper makes a significant contribution to understanding the why and the how of social entrepreneurship in responsible tourism. It provides a framework that can be widely applied to develop and enhance Weberian theory and further the understanding of the fundamental nature of human behavioral phenomena in tourism and beyond. © 2016, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

It aims to supplement existing typologies of social entrepreneurship models. To that end, building on typology it begins by providing a new framework classifying the three types of social entrepreneurship. A comparative case study of 10 Mexican social enterprises is then elaborated using that framework. Findings suggest that these distinct typologies are evolving in a dynamic manner determined by the resources and ambitions of social entrepreneurs. Starting either as social bricoleurs or as social constructionists, social entrepreneurs aspire to become social engineers. Moreover, social constructionists usually present hybrid business models. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Objective: The objective of this paper is to identify differences between measurement of organisational entrepreneurship in for-profit and non-profit context and to propose the measures aligned to non-profit organisations. The main research question is whether the scales designed to measure entrepreneurial orientation can be used in non-profit organisations and under which conditions. Research Design & Methods: Research methodology is based on review of research tools and measurement scales related to organisational entrepreneurship and comparison of for-profit and non-profit organisations, as well as their characteristics in the context of entrepreneurial orientation. Findings: Entrepreneurial orientation can be measured in non-profit organisations using existing scales that have been designed for business organisations, however they have to be modified, mostly in the dimension of competitive aggressiveness and autonomy. Additionally, the scale should be enriched with items related to cooperation with other organisations. Implications & Recommendations: It is necessary to develop methods and tools that enable the measurement of entrepreneurial orientation in non-profit organisation as well as comparative research on entrepreneurial orientation in for-profit and non-profit organisations. Contribution & Value Added: The originality of this work lies in studying some aspects of entrepreneurial orientation, that apply to the social context. Some suggestions were formulated relating to the utilisation of entrepreneurial orientation scales (orig-inally designed for business enterprises) in non-profit organisations. © 2018, Cracow University of Economics.

The goal is to educate globally-engaged problem solvers who can create sustainable and scalable value for partnering communities, while simultaneously generating and disseminating new knowledge and lessons learned. This article describes the genesis, foundational philosophies, programmatic learning outcomes, and course mechanics of the HESE Program. The eplum model of student engagement, which embeds HESE sub-projects into regular credit classes and provides rigorous yet non-travelbased experiences to a cross section of students, is discussed. A mixed methods approach is utilized to examine the effectiveness and impact of the eplum curricular model on student learning, specifically in the areas of global awareness, multidisciplinary teamwork, and entrepreneurship education. The entrepreneurial and research outcomes of the program are summarized with a culminating discussion on the emergence of an educational and entrepreneurial ecosystem that has proved pivotal to actualize the ventures and achieve sustainable impact.},

abstract={Academic programs focused on engineering entrepreneurship are growing in number and popularity at American universities. However, the fields of engineering, entrepreneurship and technology-based entrepreneurship struggle to recruit and retain female students: a historic and endemic failure at obtaining gender-balanced participation. Understanding the motivations of women engaged in such academic programs can influence recruitment and retention strategies and lead to the creation of transformative learning environments and entrepreneurial ecosystems. This study investigates the motivations that women have for participating in the Humanitarian Engineering and Social Entrepreneurship (HESE) program at Penn State. In this five-year study, females from diverse academic majors cited the following to be their top motivations for participating: a) becoming a global professional; b) making a difference; and c) applying theory learned in school to address a problem. In contrast, males cited 1) making a difference 2) participating in an exciting real-world project and 3) applying theory to address a problem, as their top motivations. Studying the motivations and perceptions of enterprising women and men provides compelling insights to help make academic engineering entrepreneurship programs more appealing to both female and male students.},

abstract={Germany is a classic example of a conservative welfare state. The production of social services is characterized by a deeply rooted tradition of corporatist governance, in which the “market” has wielded only marginal influence. Since the late 1990s, these corporatist arrangements have been challenged by the growing pressure for marketization; at the same time, a new discourse on social entrepreneurship and innovation has gained importance. This article examines the empirical impact of the social entrepreneurship movement in two domains: old-age care and youth welfare. We discuss the potential role of social entrepreneurship in these fields and argue for a realistic view of the potential for new actors in established governance arrangements. Our observations lead us to conclude that social innovation has developed not primarily as the result of challenges from new actors but rather from intrapreneurship: social innovations originating from within the established organizational field. © The Author(s) 2013.},

Based on the scientific literature, we identified several potentially important personal characteristics: creativity, proactivity, compassionate love for humanity, hardship in life and moral judgement competence. These characteristics were adequately measured and compared between three groups of students: those that want to become commercial entrepreneurs, those that want to become social entrepreneurs, and those who have no entrepreneurial intentions. The methods we used were one-way ANOVA and factor analysis. Our results showed that the factor that differed the most between the observed groups was compassionate love for humanity.

We first review the literature to identify three different conceptualisations of the concept of hybridity and its relation to the study on nonprofit organisations. We then look at hybridity in social housing in Ireland over three centuries-drawing upon previous empirical research from Mullins et al. (Non-profit housing organisations in Ireland, North and South: changing forms and challenging futures. Northern Ireland Housing Executive, Belfast, 2003) and Rhodes (Public services as complex adaptive systems: a framework for theory development.

We conclude that the ‘fit-for-purpose’ approach as represented by Dees and Anderson (Society 40:16-27, 2003) and explored in recent social entrepreneurship literature is most relevant to the Irish case, and suggest that this should be augmented by the argument put forth by Mullins et al. (Hous Stud 27(4):405-417, 2012) that the concept of hybridity is more analytically valuable as a dynamic process rather than a static description. © 2014 International Society for Third-Sector Research and The Johns Hopkins University.},

This quest might lead to complex challenges and conundrums, similar to those that arise in family businesses composed of closely intertwined systems of ‘family’ and ‘business’. Therefore, we question whether drawing on family business scholarship can help social entrepreneurship researchers move the field forward. Relying on a systems model, we conceptually frame three organizational challenges of social business venture management that can be addressed by insights from the family business literature: aligning multiple stakeholders, achieving competitive advantages and enacting sustainable solutions. To analyse these, we turn to three main theories drawn from family business research – organizational identity theory, resource-based view and stewardship theory. As a result, we formulate research questions relevant for future social entrepreneurship research. By doing so, we hope to offer social entrepreneurship scholars some guiding principles that are grounded on the experience of researchers who have analysed similar circumstances and challenges in other contexts. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Networking has been suggested as a tool to address the challenges of social entrepreneurs in severely resource constrained environments. Especially in countries where women do not usually take part in economic activities, like in Bangladesh, stimulating networking and entrepreneurship among women could have a high impact. We use longitudinal data gathered over two years, to study how entrepreneurial networks are developed and used by female entrepreneurs in Bangladesh, and how a third party can stimulate network development. We followed 26 women from the start of their entrepreneurial development. Adopting a social capital perspective on network formation and development, we identified four essential strategies in building entrepreneurial networks: modifying and building on existing bonding networks, transferring linking ties, teaching how to build bridging networks, and the creation of a network of entrepreneurial peers. We found that a third party can successfully stimulate network development for the poorest in Bangladesh. We also found that the patterns of network development in this severely resource-constraint environment are remarkably different from those found in corporate studies. Our findings can contribute to developing new pathways to stimulate entrepreneurship in developing countries. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={There has been an increasing interest in social entrepreneurs' roles in creating social value, fostering economic development, and advancing environmental sustainability. In institutional economics, there is extensive support for entrepreneurship as having a positive impact on economic development and personal wellbeing. This paper challenges the accepted understanding of social entrepreneurs as being "heroic," and their process of starting a new venture as beginning with passion or with the recognition of a social problem. Through examining the case of Clean the World, a social enterprise, we demonstrate that not all social ventures start with the intention of creating social value, but with the question: How can I make a profit? We discuss a recently proposed paradigm called effectual entrepreneurship, and then we illustrate how this paradigm fits the path of Clean the World. Effectual entrepreneurs have questioned the status quo and have focused on the existing or available resources, rather than on identifying opportunities first. We then explore how Clean the World fell into social entrepreneurship by "accident," while considering waste a resource. We conclude by making some suggestions about how to facilitate more of these "accidents" by fostering a culture that questions the status quo. © 2014, Journal of Economic Issues / Association for Evolutionary Economics.},

abstract={Aid efforts in Africa often fail, sometimes increasing the very problems they are meant to ease. A grassroots effort we call the Londolozi model is bringing local South Africans out of poverty by restoring their homeland's ecosystem. Based on principles of social empathy to develop local ecotourism, the model demonstrates how it is possible to generate a small, medium, and micro-enterprise economy that creates jobs for the local community. In addition, the Londolozi learning center and the private, not-for-profit Good Work Foundation have worked in partnership with the local community to offer adult literacy training, educational opportunities for children and youth, AIDS education, and other sustainable services necessary to end poverty. The basic precepts of the Londolozi model and principles of social empathy can be used to promote social development in other parts of Africa, as well as in other regions of the world. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

To enable subsequent comparative studies, the author first traces social enterprises' conceptual underpinnings from most current research found in leading journals and subsequently creates a framework based upon social origins theory for use on Austria's social enterprises. In order to validate the findings, the author employs a triangulated research approach, including an online-based survey, semi-structured interviews and two panel discussions. Social enterprises in Austria are characterized through social activities, organizational types, legal forms, the society sector, the outcome emphasis, and the strategic development base. The social entrepreneur him/ herself was included as a source for a qualitative triangulation as well as a distinctive item. Austria's SEs are found to work in a multitude of fields, are independent, use market-based approaches, employ improvisation and innovation for the creation of social good and incorporate a strong entrepreneurial spirit. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={The literature on entrepreneurship typically distinguishes two types of entrepreneurship: traditional business entrepreneurship and social entrepreneurship. The traditional entrepreneur takes risks to develop a business activity for personal gain. Social entrepreneurship develops businesses that are locally owned and controlled to build socially owned assets. Those who have been economically marginalised, are able to create a more stable life for themselves and their families. But when these ventures are cooperatives, is this the same as social entrepreneurship? The authors elaborate a model for three types of entrepreneurship. This theoretical model is then applied to an analysis of two cases of cooperative entrepreneurship. This model is considered against the Mondragon Cooperative Corporation as an effective example of co-operative entrepreneurship. The article also points out the limits of MCC as a model for co-operative entrepreneurship through the examination of Co-operative Ownership Development Corporation (CODC) in Silver City, New Mexico. This article draws on the literature of entrepreneurship as well as data from research conducted in Mondragon, Spain and in Silver City, New Mexico.},

abstract={Over half of the world's population lives on less than $2 a day, and yet international business education to date has continued to ignore the not so well-off customers. We propose a holistic pedagogical approach to studying this market by considering the historical background of the growth of inequality and poverty in different regions of the world, as well as the criteria for segmenting various levels of poverty. A two-pronged approach is then suggested to addressing poverty issues: first, showing how traditional international business principles can be adapted to address the needs of the impoverished market segment using a macro (top-down) approach, and second, how this untapped market can be harnessed for profits while simultaneously uplifting them out of poverty using principles of social entrepreneurship as a micro (bottom-up) approach. Exemplar case studies are used to illustrate these strategies, as are catalytic factors such as investments in technology, education, and capital, which help alleviate poverty in both cases. Finally, a debate about which of the strategies is more effective is outlined with respect to the salient issues. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Second, utilising the social network theory, we introduce the social entrepreneurial environment as a key indicator of the likelihood of entrepreneurial activity. Using the data provided by the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) project, we provide an alternative measure of entrepreneurial activity, which includes entrepreneurial social environment, assumes the existence of a continuum in entrepreneurial behaviour and provides a measure of entrepreneurial propensity. Results indicate that our model provides support for the combined use of entrepreneurial propensity and the entrepreneur's social context. © 2008, Inderscience Publishers.},

In-depth evaluation of the UK’s Neighbourhood Support Fund, a ‘flagship’ program designed to combat the social exclusion of disaffected young people living in deprived inner urban areas, demonstrates that to operate successfully in the current policy environment, community-based projects not only need these skills but must also acquire managerial capacity. In particular they have to be able meet the increasing demand from central government for detailed performance data. Successful community based projects therefore not only need to have the capacity for entrepreneurial activity but must now also have managerial skills not traditionally associated with the ‘not for profit’ organisations. © 2005, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

The model antecedents stem from two categories of perceived variables, self-referent efficacy and perceived situational fit, which can result in pathways toward three outcomes, entrepreneurial goal striving, aspiration, and eudaimonic well-being. Among the five tested antecedents (experience mastery, social assertiveness, autonomy, effectual reward, and pro-sociality), experience mastery, social assertiveness, and autonomy have strong relationships with aspiration and eudaimonic well-being. Effectual reward has significant, but the least, effects on entrepreneurial goal striving. Pro-sociality measurements exhibit strong communality and cross-variability among the other antecedents. The results show that pro-sociality cannot be determined as a discernible source of entrepreneurial motivation but has an antithetical role in volitional intention. This study sheds light on self-motivational constructs that ultimately shape social entrepreneurs’ intention and orientation. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

Digitalisation can leverage these conditions in promoting national well-being. The study also contributes to entrepreneurship literature as it clarifies the role of social entrepreneurship. Social entrepreneurship impacts national well-being when institutions are weak, but it is indifferent in developed economies, which gives support to the institutional void perspective. This finding contributes to the ongoing debate on the role of the institutions on the creation of social enterprises and advances knowledge on the social impact of social entrepreneurship.

KISS differ from KIBS in that KISS agents are specializing in social innovations. KISS also involve third party agents - public and private - in the service relationship.

abstract={Research on societal grand challenges has become a major theme in management research. Societal grand challenges require joint efforts by private, public, and social sector organizations and are described in the framework of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). One major contributor to this framework are social entrepreneurial ventures. Aligning their interventions and indicators with the SDGs can provide them with great benefits such as facilitating resource mobilization and increasing legitimacy among stakeholders. The majority of research on SDGs tends to understand the SDG framework as inherently good, as a powerful compass and narrative to create social value and take action. However, taking-for-granted that social entrepreneurial ventures readily materialize the SDGs seems to neglect the question of whether they accept the framework and how an utilization may differ among them. Drawing on qualitative interviews of 15 social entrepreneurial ventures, we address this gap and identify three distinct types of SDG utilization, namely SDG evangelism, SDG opportunism, and SDG denial. Our study contributes to research on the intersection of social entrepreneurship and societal grand challenges by uncovering the roles of resourcefulness and deviance in SDG utilization. Furthermore, we identify trust between the United Nations and social entrepreneurial ventures as a determinat for SDG utilization and provide several practical implications. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The solutions to the grand challenges of sustainability, poverty, and health affecting the world will require education and capacity building for all individuals implementing change on a global scale. The challenge ahead is to reach those missed by traditional education and support networks. Online Learning and Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have the potential to build knowledge and share best practice experiences among individuals worldwide. This paper examines the case of the FutureLearn Social Enterprise Program, a series of MOOCs with over 50,000 registered learners, of which 15% become active learners, engaging in online exercises, debates, and conversations. This paper draws on quantitative and qualitative data collected over four years. The findings show that the course has not only had an impact on the creation of new startup social enterprises, but it has also supported a large proportion of learners in developing sustainability and social entrepreneurial ideas within a range of organisations in the public, private, and civil society sectors. The findings also show a positive cascading impact effect from the learners registered on the course to those in their network, as ideas are shared, and learners become mentors to others. Our conclusions demonstrate how digital education and online courses contribute to global education for sustainable development and social enterprise development. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Enabling resources are the array of tangible and intangible assets that social entrepreneurs mobilize or create to bring forward novel place-based initiatives, to respond to unmet sustainability challenges and ideally contribute to virtuous processes of socio-economic transformation. Understanding the role of resources in constraining or enabling the development of social enterprises holds important implications not merely for the initiatives, but also for the places where they are embedded. Existing studies fail to provide a comprehensive, empirically grounded account of resources for place-based social entrepreneurship. This paper aims to fill this gap, by exploring the array of resources that enable and constrain the development of Green Care practice, i.e., nature-based activities with a social innovation purpose. Three communities of Finnish practitioners—a nature-tourism company, a care farm, and a biodynamic farm—were involved over the span of 3 years in research activities conducted with an in-depth qualitative approach. Participants were engaged in several stages of iterative learning combining conventional and action-research methods: semi-structured interviews, participatory mapping, and a co-creation workshop. Results show that entrepreneurs resort to a great variety of enabling resources, inclusive of both tangible and intangible assets, that are only marginally considered by relevant literature. Based on these findings, the paper proposes a novel set of enabling resources, comprehensive of nine clusters: infrastructural, institutional, material, place-specific, organizational culture-related, social, ethical, affective, and competence-related. Two concluding insights can be inferred: understanding resources is paramount to grasp possibilities and challenges of place-based entrepreneurship; in-depth participatory processes are needed for a thorough and grounded investigation of enabling resources in places. © 2019, The Author(s).},

abstract={University students will be our future business leaders, and will have to address social problems caused by business by implementing solutions such as social entrepreneurship ventures. In order to facilitate the learning process that will foster social entrepreneurship, however, a more holistic pedagogy is needed. Based on learning theory, we propose that students’ social entrepreneurship actions will depend on their learning about CSR and their absorptive capacity. We propose that instructors and higher education institutions can enhance this absorptive capacity by exploiting Web 2.0 technologies. We tested our proposition with a sample of 425 university students using structural equation modeling and found support for the proposed relationships. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={Purpose: The exploration of performance determinants in social enterprises has gained increasing relevance among researchers and practitioners, particularly in rural tourism. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the contributions of transformational leadership and social entrepreneurship to the performance of social enterprises in the context of rural tourism. Further, the mediating roles of social capital, creativity and social value were investigated. Design/methodology/approach: Data were gathered through a survey of 168 employees of social enterprises operating in the rural tourism setting. Eight surveyors were sent out to conduct the survey. Data were analyzed by structural equation modeling (SEM) using AMOS 18.0. Findings: The results of the SEM suggested that transformational leadership is positively associated with social value, social capital and performance of social enterprise. In addition, social entrepreneurship had a significant influence on social value, social capital and performance of social enterprise. Creativity and social value predicts the performance of social enterprise. Further, social capital was found to have a positive relationship with creativity. Finally, the mediating roles of social capital, creativity and social value were also confirmed. The findings thus highlight the power of the social value creation and social capital in the social enterprises operating in the rural destinations. Social implications: The findings assert that social entrepreneurship and transformational leadership are key sources of social value creation, social capital and creativity in rural tourism context indicating the need for additional efforts on this kind of entrepreneurial activity. The findings can motivate policymakers to promote social entrepreneurship in rural tourism destinations as a means of stimulating bottom-up social capital and social value creation. Originality/value: This study is among the first to examine the hypothesized relationships focusing on tourism social enterprises. � 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Impact investing pursues the dual goals of creating socio-economic value for themarginalized, and ensuring net positive financial returns. Impact investing firms achieve their goals through their investments in projects and enterprises which create both social and commercial values. The primary aim of this article is to contribute to our understanding of the process of impact investing, particularly with respect to issues related to aligning impact investing and investee social enterprise goals. The research method employs case-based research methodology. The data consist of six cases of impact investing and their investee social enterprises. In addition, the data involve interviews with experts from the field of impact investing. The findings are that: (1) Social mission plays an important moderating role in the inter-organizational relationship between the impact investor and the investee social enterprise, (2) and an emphasis on due diligence, sector specialization, and communication increases the likelihood of investment while (3) social impact measurement and reporting and frequent engagement increase the likelihood of post-investment alignment. The key contribution of this article is that impact investing (unlike venture capital) is influenced by the ability of its investee to create social value, which plays an important role in the inter-organizational relationship between investor and investee. Furthermore, similar to industry specialization in the for-profit investing, social sector specialization is equally relevant for alignment and returns. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={This research examines the role of digital technology in the constitution of meaningful work. Adopting a sociomaterial perspective, we argue that meaningful work emerges as an outcome of a complex negotiation between individuals and their digital devices. This process was explored through video diaries and interviews with social entrepreneurs, capturing moments of their everyday meaning-making and encouraging reflexivity. Accounting for their sociomaterial practice led participants to reaffirm their work as uniquely meaningful, produce more nuanced accounts of meaningfulness and/or make pragmatic adjustments to their meaning making. Whilst authenticity was a key meta-narrative in these accounts, it also produced tensional knots which, in their unravelling, required the adoption of more practicable meanings of work. The paper concludes by urging scholars to de-centre the human from their analysis to provide a more complete account of meaningful work. © 2018 The Authors Journal of Management Studies published by Society for the Advancement of Managment Studies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={Objective: Discovering and categorising the entrepreneurial motivations of university student entrepreneurs in the CEE region, and uncovering the influencing factors behind the different motivation factors. The aim is to understand what factors shape the social motivations of entrepreneurs, and give insights on how these motivations may be enhanced in order to make social entrepreneurship more effective. Research Design & Methods: The study is based on the 2016 GUESSS database that contains 19.338 answers for eight selected CEE countries. Factor analysis was used to detect the motivation factors; a General Linear Model was set up to identify the influencing factors of the Social mission, one of the motivation factors of the university student entrepreneurs. Findings: Five factors of entrepreneurial motivations were identified: Social mission, Customer focus, Competition/market focus, Individual goals, and Collective/community goals. Most of the factors are intrinsic in nature. Social mission factor is influenced by education, the entrepreneurship-related courses and programmes, a cultural dimension called uncertainty avoidance, and country-level characteristics that are not cultural in nature. Implications & Recommendations: Entrepreneurship courses and programmes influence attitudes and motivations, and so higher education institutions should focus on such programmes. The standard courses do not enhance the importance of intrinsic motivations, such as the social mission, so more emphasis should be put on the social dimensions. Contribution & Value Added: Our study contributes to the entrepreneurial motivations and social innovation literature, and calls for further comparative research, as the social mission GLM showed that country-level differences exist in the CEE region. © 2019, Cracow University of Economics.

To be perceived as externally legitimated by society, social enterprises often engage in strategic partnerships. However, scholars have only recently turned their attention to the legitimating function of such partnerships. The purpose of this article is to address the hitherto neglected construct of inter-partner legitimacy. Drawing on institutional theory, we hypothesize that such inter-partner legitimacy affects the resource transfer among partners, which will, in turn, be recognized by society and will subsequently affect each partner’s external legitimacy. Dyadic data of 121 strategic partnerships between social enterprises and their key partners confirm our hypotheses. We add to institutional theory by integrating the often ignored dimension of inter-partner legitimacy into our analysis and demonstrate its relevance to each partner’s external legitimacy and to resource transfer. Further contributions to the literature on institutional theory, legitimacy, social entrepreneurship, and inter-organizational relationships are identified. © The Author(s) 2016.},

Through an online and offline survey, a sample of Taiwanese agricultural college students (n=464) were recruited for analysis. The factor analyses supported previous studies and proved that the factor structures of subscales used in this study were stable, with the exception of social entrepreneurial self-efficacy. Multiple regression analysis results indicated that management efficacy was the most prominent factor affecting social entrepreneurial conviction, followed by stakeholder perspective and communication efficacy. In addition, management efficacy was the strongest factor affecting social entrepreneurial preparation, followed by stakeholder perspective and affective empathy. Notably, cognitive empathy was revealed to be negatively associated with social entrepreneurial preparation. Social capital and support were found to have no association with social entrepreneurial intentions. © 2018 Yu and Wang.},

abstract={The goal of this research is to acknowledge the elements which hinder or facilitate the transition from linear to the circular economy in the textile and apparel sector in Romania by identifying current and desired interactions among the ecosystem’s stakeholders. Two strands of literature, one on circular economy and one on the textile and apparel sector, provide the theoretical background for this research. Currently, the way we design, produce, and use clothing has drawbacks that are becoming increasingly clear. The circular economy principles have the potential to transform the way textiles are produced, consumed and disposed of. More and more social entrepreneurs are pioneering the future of the apparel industry by offering sustainable solutions to tackling systemic problems. However, their efforts have to be elevated and amplified, as such to pave the way for creating business models that allow for both economic performance and social impact. A comprehensive mapping of ongoing activities and stakeholders in the textile and apparel sector in Romania is required to understand the roadblocks to industry transformation in the context of moving toward circular economy and to implement envisioned sustainable solutions. In the paper we used a database of 27 stakeholders, developed by applying the snowball method, to investigate current and future interactions between the main actors who operate in the textile and apparel sector. To meet its research objectives, the paper employed a phenomenological research design and built upon a workshop activity. First, we designed an online survey to understand the profile and knowledge of the circular economy of the stakeholders included in our database. Second, we employed the world café method to understand in depth the level of knowledge of the actors who attended the workshop on the circular economy in the textile and apparel sector. Third, we used the structural systemic constellations method in assessing the stakeholders’ current and future desired interactions. Last, we formulated conclusions and recommendations about future research needed to deepen the understanding of the circular economy in the textile and apparel sector. Findings showed that there is a vicious circle of different actions feeding isolation and preventing collaboration among stakeholders. Also, we found that there is a lack of collaborative spaces where stakeholders can meet, connect and explore the various opportunities to collaborate, and a lack of general awareness on “circular economy and textile and apparel” and its mechanisms. The intended audiences of the research are decision-makers and practitioners in the textile and apparel sector, as well as researchers focused on the circular economy. © 2018, Sciendo.

In this essay, we seek to address this lack of attention and to shed light on the prospects and possibilities for the study and practice of innovation in poor places.

abstract={A country's National Innovation Policies (NIP) often center on military, energy or other national security missions. Yet many countries' NIPs have resulted in tremendous societal benefit through both planned and unplanned action not associated with these goals. Socially important technology product platforms often are developed at facilities that are part of National Innovation Systems. Yet the policies that govern Social Entrepreneurial Action (SEA) at these facilities are unclear. If there is not a place for SEA in these facilities for technology transfer practice then there is cause for concern. Here we add to the growing literature on SEA by utilizing the case study method to investigate how SEA has been utilized by the US National Innovation Systems (NIS) for the benefit of society. We do this by investigating two cases which emphasize internal (corporate) and external SEA in a research facility within the US NIS. We demonstrate how a US national laboratory's external engagement of SEA led to one of the most important innovations of the last half of the 20th century – the Laminar Flow Clean Room. We also show how internal SEA led to the emergence of the National Institute for Nanotechnology Engineering (NINE). The “NINE program” created a pathway enabling the emergence of nascent policy makers, technologists and entrepreneurial professionals. We then provide a model for SEA at US national laboratories through technology able social innovators and identify a new type of internal and external social entrepreneur – the Technologically Able Social Entrepreneur (TASE). © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The marketisation of social sector organisations or social marketisation emerged and spread around the world in the past three decades. In contrast with existing literature which claims that social marketisation makes social sector organisations reduce their efforts on advocacy and thus harms a civil society, this research argues that social marketisation is positively contributed to the influence of third sector organisations on government policies, and thus it strengthens civil society, rather than erodes it. Based on the National Survey of Charities and Social Enterprises in the UK, the results of regression analyses indicate clearly that, when other factors are equal, the two indicators of social marketisation, social entrepreneurship and achieving government contracts for purchasing services, are both statistically significant in estimating the level of policy influence of third sector organisations. The contribution of this research is that it finds a positive, instead of a negative, relationship between social marketisation and the perceived policy influence of third sector organisations. © 2017, The Author(s).},

abstract={In developing countries, governments, non-governmental organizations, and social entrepreneurs are disseminating agricultural information to farmers to improve their welfare. However, instead of having direct access to the information, farmers usually acquire information from local social networks, and, thus, they may have very different information channels. We establish a general framework that accommodates highly asymmetric information structures to study farmers' information management and utilization problems. In our model, a bipartite graph describes which subset of signals is accessible to a farmer. We characterize a unique Bayesian Nash equilibrium and express farmers' strategies and expected profits in closed form. We discuss properties of this equilibrium and show that asymmetric information structures can lead to various novel results. For example, a farmer may produce more (less) when observing a pessimistic (optimistic) signal, may benefit from the improvement of a signal she cannot observe, may want to share her signal with others, and may become worse off when another farmer releases a signal to her. We conduct comprehensive studies on the equilibrium in the “weak signal limit,” where signals are subject to substantial noise. We examine the government's optimal information allocation in this limit when its goal is to maximize farmers' total profits or the social welfare. To improve farmers' total profits, the government should provide all its information to (and only to) one farmer. We establish an index to determine which farmer should get the information. In contrast, to maximize the social welfare, the government should provide all its information to all farmers. © 2016 Production and Operations Management Society},

It is a means by which they can assert their rights to design, develop and maintain Indigenous-centric political, economic and social systems and institutions. In order to develop an integrated and comprehensive understanding of the intersection between Indigenous entrepreneurship and hybrid ventures, this chapter adopts a case study approach to examining Indigenous entrepreneurship and the underlying global trends that have influenced the design, structure and mission of Indigenous hybrid ventures. The cases present how Indigenous entrepreneurial ventures are, first and foremost, hybrid ventures that are responsive to community needs, values, cultures and traditions. They demonstrate that Indigenous entrepreneurship and hybrid ventures are more successful when the rights of Indigenous peoples are addressed and when these initiatives are led by or engage Indigenous communities. The chapter concludes with a conceptual model that can be applied to generate insights into the complex interrelationships and interdependencies that influence the formation of Indigenous hybrid ventures and value creation strategies according to three dimensions: (i) the overarching dimension of indigeneity and Indigenous rights; (ii) indigenous community orientations and (iii) indigenous hybrid venture creation considerations. © Copyright 2018 by Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Design/methodology/approach: The study used a qualitative case study approach with 15 island communities located off the north and west coasts of Scotland and who were engaged in the development and implementation of renewable energy initiatives. Findings: Peripheral communities provide an environment where entrepreneurial activities can flourish. Through a model of social enterprise, they were able to develop the necessary mechanisms to increase socio-economic resilience. The study indicates the importance of social capital in this process. Research limitations/implications: External networks provide part of the framework to overcome market imperfections caused by distance and remoteness so that social entrepreneurs can develop their ability to build resilience and sustainability. More research is needed on how this framework can be utilised. Social implications: In spite of the challenges presented in remote areas, these communities have shown the ability to adapt. This is an important component of resilience building. Originality/value: This paper makes a unique contribution to the knowledge base through the interconnected concepts of social entrepreneurship and social capital. It provides new empirical insights into social enterprises and describes the mechanisms that help to build resilient rural communities in the context of renewable energy endeavours. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Consistent with TPB, attitude, social norms, and perceived behavioural control were all significantly associated with intent. Importantly however, the relative weight seniors gave these components differed from that of prime age participants. For seniors, the belief that they had the requisite competencies and resources needed to own a business was especially important. Seniors also expressed greater relative interest in social entrepreneurship. The implications of these findings for both researchers and public policy makers are considered. Copyright © 2015 ASAC.},

Governance is important in the management of stakeholders in order to be entrepreneurial while being accountable. Stakeholders support the organization based on legitimacy that is gained through creating stakeholder value and by conforming to existing social structures as well as creating new operating models, practices and ideas. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={This study looked at the current status of Korean social enterprises and their problems and suggested governmental policy implications for enhancing the competitiveness of social enterprises. As the study methods, the current status of social enterprises was analyzed and performance of social enterprise support was examined and then policy implications for promoting the social enterprises were analyzed. First, the direction of governmental policy regarding the promotion of social enterprise should be converted into the ecosystem oriented or each business oriented getting out of the labor cost oriented and should emphasize on the follow up management and evaluation. Second, the certification program that bothers the expansion of social enterprises should be changed. That is, the government should change a policy into the direction that leaves the activities of social enterprise to the market function while easing the criteria of certification. Only by this, can more activities and job creation effects of social enterprise be expected. Third, the directions of governmental policies related to social entrepreneur fostering should be corrected and complemented. To resolve this so called problem, a standard model including the policy of standardized programs and contents for each business, type and local autonomous entity needs to be suggested. The educational programs and contents composed of such a standard model can enhance the professionalism and efficiency in social entrepreneur fostering. Finally the concept of social economy is needed to be more wide spread. That is, as a base of social enterprise activity, systematic and professional educational programs through university or graduate school are required. In Korea, for social enterprise to develop, excessive governmental involvement in the market should decrease. That is, the certification requirement for social enterprise should be eased much and a direct support for social enterprise should be converted into an indirect support method, which enables more activities of social enterprise and higher job creation effect. In the long term, social entrepreneurs should be fostered to enhance professionalism and efficiency so that social enterprise can have competitiveness. © 2014 Science Publication.},

abstract={This article analyses the financing structure of social enterprises which usually have access to a wide range of funding sources. Although a diversified financing structure promises stability in terms of cash flows to the business, empirical evidence shows that social enterprises have a rather concentrated financing structure. This can be explained as a diversified financing structure that can result in conflicts which either originate from the capital providers' divergent return requirements or the design of financing instruments. To reduce these conflicts, inherent in a diversified financing structure social enterprises concentrate on the most suitable financing sources. As social and financial return requirements differ between capital providers, the concentration on a reduced number of financing sources implies a more clearly defined set of expectations that the social enterprise has to consider. The social enterprise needs to adapt to the expectations of its capital providers and align the strategy accordingly. Copyright © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={This paper is conceptual in its outlook. It provides a new lens through which scholars in the emerging field of social entrepreneurship should view the concept in order to come to a better understanding of the field. It raises the question as to whether or not all enterprises that deliver a social service can be duly classified as social enterprise and be linked to the wider field of social entrepreneurship. This question becomes relevant when the context within which the social service is being delivered is taken into consideration. Garrison communities in Jamaica provided the context within which the current paper analyses the question. The paper argues that the line between violence as a business, which generate funds to support enterprises that deliver social services to ensure power and control by gang leaders and, social enterprise, which deliver social services to transform lives through the creation of social value has become blurred. This, we call the dark side of social entrepreneurship and argue that the discourse on social entrepreneurship cannot ignore this phenomenon, especially in developing countries with a high number of vulnerable communities.},

This paper evaluates critically the assumption that these hidden entrepreneurs are engaged in commercial entrepreneurship. Reporting evidence from a 2002-2003 survey involving interviews with 28 early-stage entrepreneurs operating in the hidden economy in English rural localities, the finding is that hidden entrepreneurs range from rational economic actors pursuing a purely commercial goal through to purely social entrepreneurs pursuing solely social logics, with the majority somewhere in-between combining both commercial and social goals. The outcome is a call to begin mapping the heterogeneous logics of hidden entrepreneurs in different contexts. Copyright © 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

Situated geographically with Russia and Georgia to the north, Armenia and Turkey to the West, Iran to the south, and the Caspian Sea and Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan to the east, Azerbaijan is at the sociopolitical and cultural crossroads of Russia, the Middle East, and Central Asia. Cyrus the Great of Persia occupied Azerbaijan in the sixth century B.C., followed by Alexander the Great, the Roman legions under Pompey, the Persians and the Ottomans, and finally by the Russians in the 1800s. Indeed, Azerbaijan's history is colored by the dynamics of politics, power, ideology, and gender. We first elaborate the social constructionist theoretical orientation that guides our analysis. Next, we focus on ideology and social entrepreneurs and on the social construction of gender-especially, the social construction of women's roles-during two distinct periods of Azerbaijan's "modern" history, from the 1800s to 1991. Third, we examine in greater detail the sociopolitical, economic, and ideological transition in post-Soviet Azerbaijan, from 1991 to present. We examine how this transition has affected women's place and well-being, and we focus on women's advocacy associations that-as social entrepreneurs-are assisting women in dealing with social and economic problems, redefining women's identity, and empowering women in post-Soviet Azerbaijani society.},

abstract={All social entrepreneurship experts state that the issue of definition is the main problem affecting research in this field. Although there is no single definition, this is clearly a new domain in the field of research on entrepreneurship. The main objective of this study is to further knowledge in this area by means of a systematic review of scientific literature to determine the conceptual development of social entrepreneurship and to identify the most interesting research trends. This study uses a research method, known as latent semantic analysis (LSA), which has been applied to a database of keywords collected from a rigorous selection of academic articles. The results show that this phenomenon has emerged from two parallel currents within the organization management field; on the one hand, the non-governmental organization (NGO) and voluntary tradition and, on the other, the world of business ethics and corporate social responsibility (CSR). The main lines of future research highlighted in the analysis include the measurement of social impact, venture philanthropy, and hybrid organizations. © 2021 by the authors.

Business model innovation (BMI) has been found to be important to overcome those bottlenecks, but the extant literature is limited and lacks a solid empirical foundation. To explore this topic, we conducted a retrospective analysis of a single case study, tracking the evolution of an organization's business model as it went from being a traditional, donation-based NPO, to a dynamic sales-driven social enterprise (SE). As a result, the organization gained financial autonomy, scaled up operations and increased impact. Our findings add to the literature by identifying BMI change drivers and outcomes. We show how a platform-inspired business model can enhance value creation and value capture in a SE. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={This study tested the model proposed by Hockerts, who revised the framework proposed by Mair and Noboa by retaining empathy, self-efficacy, and perceived social support and by adding moral obligation and prior experience of social problems as precursors of social entrepreneurial intentions. This model was further perfected by including personality traits as precursors and entrepreneurial creativity as a mediator. A total of 1,930 participants were included in the five subsequent survey studies. The results revealed that personality traits and prior experience predicted social entrepreneurial intentions through the mediation of entrepreneurial creativity and the four precursors identified earlier. This mediating model responded differently across academic fields, socioeconomic contexts, and work experiences mainly because of prior experience, empathy, and usefulness. Future research could investigate how the alternative model including personality traits, social responsibility, and the nature of different social problems is associated with social entrepreneurial intentions. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Extant studies have focussed on institutional work that addresses solitary institutional void, mostly in formal settings. In this paper, we inquire the case of a social entrepreneurial venture in India that identified two complementary institutional voids (productive ageing void of the urban elderly and rural education void of children) and attempted to simultaneously address the two voids. The issue of physical distance between the two groups was overcome by enacting an ICT platform. We also show how the institutional challenges associated with the ICT implementation led them to pursue different kinds of institutional works in their context. We then identify different theoretical dimensions of institutional works that could be used in marginalized contexts. Finally, we show how the ‘complementary voids’ approach has implications for both theory and practice. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={This paper aims to investigate how sustainable entrepreneurs innovate in business models to overcome their hybridity-related tensions to achieve environmental, social, and financial goals. A case study was conducted on 12 organizations in seven countries from October 2018 to June 2019 through observation visits, interviews, and secondary data collection. To analyze the data, a content analysis was applied with the help of NVivo Software. The analysis category is based on the definition of the pillars of business models: (1) Value proposition, (2) value creation/delivery, and (3) value capture. Concerning value proposition, organizations engage various stakeholders on developing emotions related to sustainable behaviors. They use the idea of community to promote it, fostering the sharing of intangible values. Associated with these actions, organizations offer more convenience accessing these products or services, home deliveries, facilitating access by geo-location, price reduction, and promoting consumers' education. Regarding value creation/delivery, companies promote partnerships with other stakeholders as part of the main business strategy. They run the business while promoting a social movement. One is dependent on the other. In their engagement in sustainability discussion forums and practical activities, they put together consumers, suppliers, and also other agents outside their vertical supply chain. Operations of all companies are highly internet-based. Social media and transparency are also relevant to their operations. The main characteristic of value capture is that organizations integrate sustainability into their strategy in a way that, just by doing business, they fulfill their social, environmental, and economic missions. Therefore, through innovation in business models, these organizations overcome hybridity-related tensions and achieve financial stability while positively impacting society. The contribution to the literature was achieved by identifying business model innovations in sustainable entrepreneurship, analyzing their characteristics and mechanisms to overcome hybridity-related tensions, and providing empirical evidence about how business models can create and capture different and multiple forms of value. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Economic growth is one of the important objectives of economic policy due to the beneficial effects it has on employment and economic well-being. The work carried out in the last few decades has highlighted the roles that entrepreneurship and innovation play in promoting this objective. However, the environmental deterioration resulting from policies implemented to stimulate growth has led to considerations of other objectives that are more compatible with the defense of the environment, such as sustainable development. Therefore, it is important to determine the factors that stimulate them. This paper considers traditional and social entrepreneurship and innovations and green innovation. The effect of institutions as generators of legal and economic environments on both types of entrepreneurship is contemplated. On the other hand, considering the possibility of "bidirectional causality", the relationship between both types of entrepreneurship and institutions is also analyzed. This will allow us to design measures aimed at stimulating sustainable development. The objective of this paper is to analyze these relationships through two estimates: first, an analysis of the relationship between both types of entrepreneurship and innovations and sustainable development and second, the relationship between social and traditional entrepreneurship and institutions. In both cases, the path coefficient of each of them is compared with respect to the final objective, which would be useful when designing economic policies. Empirical analysis is carried out, producing an estimation of the structural equation modeling (SEM) model using the partial least squares (PLS) technique in the case of 20 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={Underrepresented students face challenges in accessing entrepreneurial education and careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. In attempts to address this deficit, a five-week social entrepreneurship program (named Poder) with a focus on technology was implemented at one of the largest community college systems in the U.S. Conceptually, the program curriculum was grounded in Social Cognitive Career Theory and Critical Consciousness, two approaches noted for helping underserved students. In order to evaluate the efficacy of the program, students from diverse backgrounds (n = 106) completed pre- and post-test measures, which included instruments assessing entrepreneurial self-efficacy, entrepreneurial skills, civic participation, critical behavior, technology optimism, and technology innovation. Results from paired samples t-tests and a series of repeated measures mixed-design ANOVAS suggest that students experienced significant increases in all outcome measures, except for civic participation, and effects were not moderated by race/ethnicity, gender, or immigration status. These results suggest that the program, designed with a culturally responsive curriculum, was effective in promoting the career development of culturally diverse and underrepresented students. We discuss conceptual and practical contributions for addressing educational attainment gaps and systemic issues in entrepreneurship and STEM education. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Purpose: This paper aims to integrate research on KM with the effectuation approach. This paper will add to the understanding of effectuation as a KM tool in the context of social entrepreneurial networks. Although researchers agree that the lack of resources is a structural point for the context of social entrepreneurship and that knowledge is crucial in social entrepreneurship, only few studies deal with trying to understand how resources and knowledge are obtained, transformed and managed. An effectual approach seems to be particularly appropriate to work on this subject. Design/methodology/approach: A literature review leads to a theoretical model that is tested in a single-case study of a French entrepreneurial project. Findings: The empirical study not only shows the legitimacy of using an effectual approach but also puts forward three concepts that enable a better understanding of the access to resources and knowledge and their use in the context of social entrepreneurship. This study contributes to the knowledge management literature in identifying the process of gathering and sharing external resources and knowledge through an effectual process led by the entrepreneur and by the network. Research limitations/implications: The results complement the extant KM literature on the following points: identify the cumulative and absorptive process of knowledge from the network, contributing to the question of KM for growth and corporate entrepreneurship; answer to the claim from Durst and Runar Edvardsson (2012) to develop a greater understanding of knowledge identification, storage and utilization in small businesses; add to the topics of knowledge sharing, knowledge transfer and knowledge creation; and show that stages of creating, identifying, sharing and absorbing knowledge from/with the network are embedded in an effectual approach. Practical implications: The lack of resources should not lead the entrepreneur to a dead end, but rather invite him/her to better raise following questions: Who can help me to get the missing resource? How could I develop the project without these resources and knowledge? The entrepreneur is invited to search more flexibility in the making of the project, and to seek more support from the network. A second important implication is a guideline that can be followed by business incubators to give better advice and guidance to social entrepreneurs. Originality/value: The paper links effectuation, KM and social entrepreneurship literatures. The identification of the role of the network in knowledge creation, identification and sharing is valuable for both researchers and practitioners. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Social entrepreneurship has been recognized as an innovative and effective approach to poverty reduction and employment generation. However, the roles undertaken by social enterprises in Malaysia and Singapore are still limited and many are grappling to survive. Determine the external resources that could increase social enterprises' efficiencies and performance, are the key management issues for the external supportive bodies. Guiding by the resource dependence theory, this cross-nation quantitative study established a framework to examine the most prominent external resources (i.e., financial and training supports), which were mediated by formal business planning, towards the financial and social performance of social enterprises in the emerging contexts (i.e., Malaysia and Singapore). The empirical data on 181 Malaysian and Singaporean social enterprises were analysed by using a structural equation modelling approach. The research findings reveal that financial and training supports should be correlated closely with formal business planning in order to generate a significant impact on their organisational performance. The results showed business planning plays a dominant role between the external supports and social enterprises' performance. This challenges the conventional knowledge that common business practices of profit-driven companies are not suitable for mission-driven organisations. The moderation effects of the socio-economic context were found to be insignificant. The research model's predictive power and predictive capability for all the endogenous constructs were satisfied and assured. Furthermore, the Importance-Performance Map Analysis corresponded with the path coefficient results, the main factor to enhance social enterprises' performance is through the improvement in business planning practices, and financial support is another area to enhance their social performance. © 2019},

abstract={Universities have recently been pressurized to go beyond their economic conceptualization of third-mission activities and contribute to solving grand societal challenges in the regions in which they are located. Social entrepreneurship has emerged as one mechanism by which universities can address societal challenges. Despite a growing awareness of universities’ potential and expectations to enhance social entrepreneurship in their geographical vicinities, how these processes become legitimized within a higher education context has received surprisingly little attention. This paper, therefore, explores factors affecting the (de)legitimacy process of social entrepreneurship within universities. Using a single case study design that relies on semi-structured interviews carried out in a Dutch public university, it was found that organizational legitimacy of social entrepreneurship remains unestablished. Furthermore, the legitimacy process is affected by (1) the expectations of stakeholders, the difficulty of measuring social impact and third-mission indicators; (2) an overemphasis on high-tech research and application as an organizational identity; (3) the absence of a leader in the field and lack of organizational recognition; and (4) stringent regulations of public institutions in the Netherlands. In addition, enhancing social entrepreneurs is hindered by the lack of place-based belonging among the student body. Consequently, this paper argues that a holistic approach that focuses on the specificities of universities and the increasing competitive environment in which they have come to function, the potential facilitating role of other organizational actors in the field, and designing appropriate policy instruments and incentives would benefit universities in their efforts to enhance social entrepreneurship. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

The results of recent studies indicate the importance of managers having the capacity to understand organizational culture and link it to organizational performance improvement. This study aims to examine the relationship between organizational culture and performance improvement in social enterprises. In the past, organizational culture was described in terms of a single dimension, but it is now understood that different cultures reflect different values and beliefs, in a seemingly contradictory manner, and can coexist within any given organization. We analyze the relationships among social enterprise networking, performance, and organizational culture, using the four organizational culture classifications of the competing values framework, which reflects recent perspectives. A survey was conducted among 100 social entrepreneurs, and latent profile analysis was applied to the data. The analytical results identify four latent profiles-namely, strong-balanced, weak-balanced, hierarchical, and group-dominant-and show that a balanced culture fosters high-level socioeconomic performance. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={In recent decades, social enterprise has emerged from a variety of traditions and contexts to occupy a prominent position in relation to social change. Proponents argue that people with a business orientation are uniquely equipped to identify social problems, develop solutions and to scale these up. Muhammad Yunus and the non-collateralized loans of the Grameen Bank are held to exemplify this potential. Meanwhile, mass tourism destinations are increasingly found in less developed countries, placing relatively wealthy tourists in close proximity to poor people. One response to this has been a proliferation of social enterprises within the tourism industry. This paper investigates the potentials and limitations of social entrepreneurship to achieve inclusive tourism through an analysis of five established and highly regarded social enterprises in Siem Reap. The enterprises have created worthwhile new opportunities for poor and marginalized people and contributed substantially to revitalizing elements of Cambodian culture. Beyond these significant successes, their capacity to generate broader inclusiveness in either the tourism sector or the Cambodian economy, generally, appears limited. Continued social benefits are, furthermore, contingent on the commercial success of the enterprises, in a sector which is highly competitive and volatile, with even successful, well-run businesses never entirely secure. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to advocate for greater use of ethnographic research methods in entrepreneurship studies to produce more contextualized research. An argument for getting “up-close” and “hands-on” is presented to better understand how context shapes action in entrepreneurship than is presently achieved under the present entrepreneurship research orthodoxy. The need for contextualized research is particularly acute in the domain of social innovation. For its maturation as a field of research, it also requires stronger critical perspectives into the agendas and impacts of practitioners and other field-shaping actors. Ethnographic approaches are potentially powerful methods for revealing truths of this nature. Ethnographic methods are, however, problematic for professional researchers. The challenges of conducting such research are discussed. Design/methodology/approach: Conceptual paper regarding research methods in social innovation and social entrepreneurship studies. Findings: Social entrepreneurship that happens within established organizations is a hybrid social innovation activity that is informed, constrained, and compelled by idiosyncratic social contexts which are fashioned by institutional logics, identities, organizational culture, and history. With its contestable conceptualizations, priorities, models, purposes, and approaches, it arguably defies researchers’ ability to build a deep understanding, from arm’s length, of how the activity is undertaken for theory building purposes. Ethnographic methods enable deeper insight than traditional entrepreneurship research methods, and this research illustrates the differences between the espoused intentions, beliefs, and attitudes of managers and the lived experience of staff. Originality/value: Social entrepreneurship is a micro-level, hybrid social innovation activity that challenges embedded social, structural, and cultural norms when undertaken within established organizations. Ethnographic methods are under-utilized in exploring this and other forms of entrepreneurial action. This paper illustrates the value of ethnography for contextualizing social innovation research and that eschewing “arm’s length” objectivity for “hands-on” insight is a powerful approach to empirically contextualizing social innovation and contributing to more critical perspectives and sophisticated theory building. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

However, the value creation mechanism of SEs has not yet been disclosed. The purpose of this study is to reveal the value creation mechanism of SEs in manufacturing industry. To do so, we verify the role of social entrepreneurship and examine the effects of product innovation attributes and social capital on social value creation and financial performance by using structural equation modelling. Then, we conduct interviews with six experts in SE fields. According to the results of empirical study, the social entrepreneurship works as an antecedent of product innovation and social capital in SEs and the degrees of products' simplicity, usability and standardization positively affect the social value creation of SEs. In addition, the social value creation works as a complete mediator between the product innovation of SEs and their financial performance. The interviews suggest policy implications for successful social value creation and sustainability of SEs.

However, the decision making in such situations is a complex sociotechnical phenomenon. The literature specifies crisis response to include four steps (i.e., observation, interpretation, choice, and dissemination) and suggests a sociotechnical approach for analyzing them. However, we still lack theoretical guidelines for conducting sociotechnical analyses of the complexity involved in the crisis response activities. To help fill this knowledge gap, we present an interpretive case study on Kathmandu Living Labs’ (KLL) role in the response to the Nepal earthquake in 2015. We analyze the case using actor-network theory (ANT) and explore how a social entrepreneur from KLL enrolled different technical and human actors and mobilized them in the crisis response. We use ANT to explore the temporal and interdependent role of digital volunteers, local communities, and technologies in responding to the crisisWe demonstrate the usefulness of ANT’s translation process in understanding the complex sociotechnical process of crisis response in disaster events. © 2017 by the Association for Information Systems.},

To date, relatively few highly successful maker startups have emerged, possibly due to the dominant mindset of the makers being one of cooperation and sharing. However, makers also strive for financial stability and many have profit motives. We use a multiple case study approach to explore makers’ experiences regarding the tension between sharing and commercialization and their ways of dealing with it. We conducted interviews with maker initiatives across Europe including Fab Labs, a maker R&D center, and other networks of makers. We unpack and contextualize the concepts of sharing and commercialization. Our cross-case analysis leads to a new framework for understanding these entrepreneurs’ position with respect to common-good versus commercial offerings. Using the framework, we describe archetypal trajectories that maker initiatives go through in the dynamic transition from makers to social enterprises and social entrepreneurs. © 2017 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University},

abstract={In this study, we experimentally test the impact of a formal signal (a third-party certificate) and an informal signal (self-proclaimed management quality with respect to social entrepreneurship) on stakeholder supportive intentions and perceived organizational effectiveness. Our study confirms the social entrepreneurship advantage, but we find no proof of a convincing effect from the formal signal. However, complementary analyses and additional testing of control variables add new perspectives on the relative importance of the social entrepreneurship advantage and on potential moderators that could better explain in future studies the varying effects and specific contextual elements that influence formal and informal reputation-building signals. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.},

abstract={Co-Design’s increasing engagement with the public realm is closely related to the widespread turn towards ‘the social’ in design and design research. However, there is a lack of understanding of how the notion of the social in social design differs from social innovation and social entrepreneurship. This paper provides an inter-disciplinary examination of research literature with the purpose of positioning social design more firmly in its difference from these other approaches. One of the tangible results is an analytical framework that enables design researchers to grasp what is unique to social design and wherein lies the value for the public realm. By developing a set of defining criteria such as aim, modus operandi, social value, locus of design and innovation, and the scale of effects, the paper offers a fine-grained disentangling of the social in social design. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Mark Zuckerberg, founder and CEO of Facebook, made media headlines at the end of last year when he announced his intention to donate most of his Facebook shares to charity. This article deals with the significance and potential of individuals, such as Zuckerberg, in a globalized world, to determine global policy agendas. Philanthropists who head global foundations are the most apparent. While philanthropists’ involvement in international relations is based on their capital, celebrities increasingly use their fame to do political advocacy, and social entrepreneurs are sometimes able to initiate change based on new ideas. Contributing to the existing literature, the article compares the characteristics of these three categories and discusses their relevance against the background of the increasing delegation of authority to private actors in global governance. When dealing with non-state actors in global governance, scholars have simply assumed these actors to be collective entities. In consequence, we have missed the fact that power has not only shifted away from state actors but also increasingly concentrates on very few individuals who possess respective resources of power. The individualization of global policy processes therefore causes new problems of democratic accountability and legitimacy. © 2016 University of Durham and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd},

Design/methodology/approach: Case study of the development of FACA, an affordable medicine used to treat sickle cell disease, from traditional medicine to market in Burkina Faso. Findings: Social business models present important challenges in terms of value capture for all stakeholders. The social profit equation and the profit equation suggested by Yunus et al. are difficult to apply in practice, and therefore, social business model design should consider the social and profit equations jointly. Originality/value: Developing countries are seeking different approaches to innovation and healthcare.

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to alert the reader to the urgent need to address the most pressing challenge and opportunity of the twenty-first century, namely, leadership that enables flourishing for all forever. Design/methodology/approach: This conceptual paper suggests a heuristic for the reader and supplies a working model of leadership as enabling function for flourishing that arises from a survey of the literature around leadership development, as well as a brief review of the literature on flourishing. Findings: The paper highlights the reality that there are, as yet, only a small number of organizations and leadership that have conceptualized and implemented the notion of flourishing by design and that a great deal more research and implementation needs to occur to prove the validity of the model. Research limitations/implications: There is a need to undertake quasi-experimental research in which leadership development praxis incorporates the element of flourishing by design and then action research through which the outcomes can be measured, modified and ongoing improvements iterated into the organizational design. Practical implications: This paper suggests a different mindset and skillset for leadership and, by implication, leadership development. The ongoing research into “Seeking Best Methods for Leadership Development”, through the authors’ Round 1 Delphi survey has uncovered the elements of Human Capital, Social Capital, Structural Capital and Self Leadership, as core elements desired by global CEOs as necessary for an effective leadership development program. What the authors did not probe for, and need to probe for, is the element of “Flourishing Capital” or the degree to which the leadership might be developed to serve as an enabling function for flourishing for all forever. Social implications: If organizations design flourishing into the raison d‘être of the organization, then organizations will seek and develop leadership that has flourishing as a core motif and focus. If organizational leadership supports and enhances flourishing as a central motif, then a shift will occur from profit only to profit that supports flourishing for all forever.

A questionnaire with five dimensions (innovation/creativity; motivation; social responsibility; image and finally sales/money) was administered to 32 managers from 15 organizations that supported/sponsored a sport program designed to develop children’s social capital. Contrary to the belief that financial profit is the most compelling reason for the existence of business, companies have begun to be involved in conducting business that also involves social responsibility; increasing notoriety in the marketplace; developing actions to benefit others; demonstrating concern about challenges facing a community; increasing credibility; enhancing reputation; and creating a company culture that is inclusive of a community. This investigation reveals that corporate involvement in social responsibility initiatives improve positioning in the market place, which can reflect increased consumer loyalty. It may also increase motivation of employees which can be reflected in increased productivity. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Yet, the field has come to a crossroads in its history as many remain unsure of just how social enterprise differs from NGOs on the one hand, and standard commercial enterprises on the other. This article examines the relatively new roots of social entrepreneurship in the context of global development paradigms, looking at the pros and cons of a field which remains controversial from the perspective of both the private and the public sector. Using the model of the prominent social enterprise KickStart International, we illustrate how KickStart’s social enterprise model corresponds with current trends in the world of development internationally, with its particular focus on sub-Saharan Africa. Finally, we examine how recent evaluation research has shed light on KickStart and the contributions of social enterprise, as well as how evaluation research can inform social enterprise’s contributions to international development. © 2014, International Society for Third-Sector Research and The Johns Hopkins University.},

abstract={The editors of this volume identify four critical roles that ranking and rating organizations (RROs) perform. They act as judges, global monitors and regulators, advocates, and as branding exercises to claim ownership over issues. In the case of credit rating agencies (CRAs), we see the first three as primary and the fourth as inapplicable in the rating of sovereign debt and in the performance of CRAs in the 2008 financial crisis that originated in repo and mortgage markets. The first role identified by the editors is what US-based rating agencies do by their own admission. They judge the creditworthiness of bond issuers, but with a twist. Protected by the first amendment to the US constitution, CRAs (the big three CRAs are all private American corporations) offer “opinions” that are taken by market and government actors to be “expert judgments.” As Fitch puts it, “ratings are not themselves facts and therefore cannot be described as ‘accurate’ or ‘inaccurate.’” Whether the opinions offered are, or are not, such a thing is a question we shall investigate below, but they are, oddly, both protected speech and a product for sale. Their second role, as monitors and regulators, is again central to what they are and do. The threat of being put on CreditWatch by Standard and Poor's (S&P), for example, is a particular monitoring category that most sovereign bond issuers would like to avoid. Yet the extent to which this monitoring and signaling actually works as advertised is again something to be investigated rather than something to be assumed. Third, CRAs are also advocates, but not in the hands of the raters themselves. We usually think of ratings as advocacy tools in the hands of social entrepreneurs and NGOs against governments and firms, as, for example, in the case of corruption indices used by pro-democracy NGOs to promote reform. In the case of the relationship between sovereigns and CRAs, however, a different dynamic unfolds. © Cambridge University Press 2015.},

abstract={Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the influence of extrinsic factors, namely, age, education, gender, marital status and income on customers’ intention to support Islamic social enterprises via donation. The paper also assesses the influence of religiosity on support intention (SI). The impact of customers’ perceptual reaction to the credibility of social enterprises’ advertising is also measured to assess its influence on SI. Design/methodology/approach - A total of 214 completed questionnaires from online and offline surveys were analysed using several statistical analyses, including structural equation modelling, to assess the effects of the independent variables on SI. Findings - The study found that customers’ socioeconomic status and religiosity have no significant influence on their intention to channel their donations via Islamic social enterprises. It is the social enterprises’ advertising which significantly influences their SI. Research limitations/implications - The study focuses on an Islamic research context of social entrepreneurship. Thus, the results cannot be generalised directly to the non-Islamic social entrepreneurship context. Practical implications - Findings of the study suggest that organisations should develop effective communication strategies through advertising to highlight organisational credibility as it plays an important role in shaping customers’ attitudes and intentions. Originality/value - The study investigates the effects of marketing on customers’ SI. It also considers credibility, advertising, and the concept of branding in a context of social entrepreneurship, a concept that is still largely unexplored in the literature. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this study is to focus on how narratives are used to acquire social venture resources. Social entrepreneurship is a phenomenon of increasing significance. A key challenge for social ventures is resource acquisition. However, how social entrepreneurs gather the resources necessary to grow their organizations is not clear.
Design/methodology/approach: This topic is examined using a multi-study, inductive, theory-building design based on 121 interviews, observation and archival data. In Study 1, 75 entrepreneurs, investors and ancillary participants were interviewed in the social enterprise sector. In Study 2, case studies of eight technology-focused social ventures were constructed.
Findings: The result of this study is a framework explaining how differences in entrepreneurs’ narrative tactics and characteristics are associated with differences in their resource acquisition success. Specifically, from Study 1, this paper develops a typology of social enterprise narratives, identifies three narrative-types (personal, social-good and business) and shows that they possess unique elements. Evidence from Study 2 suggests that the three narrative-types serve as the building blocks for communication with external stakeholders.
Originality/value: These findings contribute to three studies that formed the basis of the study – social entrepreneurship, entrepreneurial resource acquisition and organizational narrative theory – and have implications for work on competing organizational logics. They also produce several practical implications for social entrepreneurs. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={In tackling some of society's most intractable problems, social ventures often engage in strategic alliances to overcome resource constraints and scale their solutions. While considerable research has focused on why strategic alliances are created, less attention has been focused on how they form and why they may (not) persist. Building on an identity-based perspective, this paper develops a theoretical model of strategic alliance development and change by explaining how, and with what results, leaders of social ventures influence the development of organizational identities within their own organizations and strategic alliance partner organizations. The model presented in this paper contributes to the identity literature by developing a cross-level model that explains how individual identities can facilitate the development of organizational identities and by extending the individual-level construct of relational identity to the organizational level by introducing the constructs of ‘organizational’ relational identity and identification. The model contributes to the social entrepreneurship and strategy literatures by suggesting that identity explanations may inform how strategic alliances are formed and why they may (not) persist. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Abstract: In the context of the Rio Earth Summit numerous international regimes, national policies and organizational guidelines have appeared that help translate the normative demands of sustainable development into political reality. The implementation of these instruments, however, often runs into difficulties or fails entirely. An example is the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD), a progressive approach for the conservation of freshwater that is very unlikely to be implemented by 2015, the target year. We examine in this paper how a recent variation of Gandhian non-violent communication within social entrepreneurship suggests one way to deal with this challenge. Non-violent communication, rooted in Gandhian social action, has long been part of environmental politics. It has undergone a new variation as a mode of communication in the hands of social entrepreneurship initiatives that address urgent social and environmental issues with new, practical ideas. In the conceptual part of this paper, we outline our approach to sustainability, non-violent communication and social entrepreneurship. In a further part, we present data from a trans-disciplinary experiment to illustrate and critically discuss social entrepreneurship as a mode of sustainability communication. The experiment looked at, which is based on French social entrepreneur Roberto Epple's idea of a Big Jump, is a collaborative campaign that invites young people to take action for water conservation in the context of the WFD.},

abstract={Even though the practice of social entrepreneurship has a long history, the field has only begun to gain academic attention in the past few decades. However, most of the literature to date focuses on theoretical and conceptual issues, and there continues to be a paucity of empirical work in this discipline. Using the number of social entrepreneurs in a country as a proxy for prevalence of the phenomenon is a strong predictor - the validity of the results was confirmed using two reputable databases of social entrepreneurs, i.e., the Ashoka and Schwab Foundations. Furthermore, the components of national-level attitudes for general entrepreneurship, i.e., perceived opportunity, no fear of failing, and aspirations of new technology, were found to be positively correlated with social entrepreneurship at the country level. Yet, national-level attitudes for networking and opportunities for start-ups, generally correlated with general entrepreneurship, were negatively correlated with social entrepreneurship. We also discuss the implications of our findings and discuss their consequences as well as suggestions for future research. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyse a women entrepreneurial model that promotes inclusive strategy and organizational structure for sustainable outcomes in a masculine society. Design/methodology/approach: The paper adopts qualitative research methods, such as case study and in-depth interviews, to analyse possible factors that promote sustainable outcomes among rural women entrepreneurs, such as purpose, processes and products of the strategy and stakeholders. The paper reviews existing literature on women entrepreneurship, especially in a masculine society. Findings: The analysis reveals that women face three primary challenges: ability to take financial risk, ability to mitigate organisational risk, and ability to empower as a social collective. It also highlights that there are different phases of enterprise development and each phase requires a dedicated strategy. Lastly it identifies several social, political and economic advantages that are embedded in a social enterprise, if a social entrepreneurial sustainable model is adopted. Research limitations/implications: This paper is confined to qualitative methods applied to key resource persons and case study. The paper does not include a survey of all the beneficiaries. Practical implications: The outcome of this paper shall be useful for the government, funding agencies, and non-government organisations to formulate an inclusive and sustainable policy that enables women to become successful entrepreneurs. Social implications: This paper will influence across South Asia that faces similar socio-economic challenges of women marginalization. Originality/value: The paper is unique in providing a social entrepreneurship sustainable model for promoting inclusive outcomes in a masculine society. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: In the context of contemporary debates on ecopreneurship and sustainable livelihoods, this article seeks to compare two programmes to promote a certain type of agro-economic practice among rural farmers. By following the successes and failures of these programmes, the text interrogates how such initiatives are evaluated by the surrounding community of aid agencies and governmental bodies. Design/methodology/approach: Deploying the theoretical notion of "performativity", as used within economic anthropology, the article posits that the above-mentioned programmes can be construed as economic experiments. More specifically, the text compares two concurrent initiatives: One ecopreneurial experiment instigated by a social entrepreneur, and one livelihoods-focussed experiment instigated by an aid agency. The case study is based upon material from a three-year ethnography of entrepreneurship-promoting programmes in Hambantota, Sri Lanka. Findings: While the ecopreneurial venture fails, the livelihoods-based initiative proves successful in demonstrating its economic validity. The case study indicates that, in the context of modes of evaluation focusing on day-to-day incomes of farmers, it may be difficult for ecopreneurs to make room for ecological experimentation. Originality/value: Having identified this "ecopreneur's dilemma", the article prompts scholars and policy-makers to investigate it further, and potentially re-examine how the livelihoods agenda is implemented in practice. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={It has become axiomatic in recent years for scholars to make two observations concerning social entrepreneurship: first, that there is no definitive consensus about what the term actually means (Light, 2006, 2008; Perrini, 2006); second, that the research agenda for the field is not yet clearly defined (Nicholls, 2006a, 2006b, 2009; Short et al., 2009). It has also been noted that the community of scholars currently engaging with the subject is small, under-resourced, and somewhat marginalized (Battle Anderson & Dees, 2006). Kuhn (1962) observed that an established academic paradigm attracts legitimacy and resources to a field of action that are largely withheld in a pre-paradigmatic state. Following Kuhn, the current status of social entrepreneurship can be conceptualized as a field that has yet to achieve a paradigmatic consensus and that lacks a ŉormal science’ or clear epistemology. However, despite the apparent constraints of its pre-paradigmatic status, an analysis of social entrepreneurship suggests that emergent patterns of institutionalization can be discerned, each characterized by its own discourses, narrative logics and ideal-type organizational models. Such patterns are characterized here as contests for the control of the legitimating discourses that will determine the final shape of the social entrepreneurial paradigm. This is a particular characteristic of a field that is at a less well-developed stage of legitimacy than the key paradigm-building actors within it. © Palgrave Macmillan, a division of Macmillan Publishers Limited 2012.},

By engaging in cultural learning of local norms in Kenya Horace Tipton has provided a model case for increasing the standard of living in this economically poor part of the world. However, both Horace and the Kenya farmers faced acculturation-related challenges in enacting and benefitting from the program. In this paper, we use excerpts from interviews and blog sites to illustrate that the success of the programs may be attributed, in part, to individual and group cultural learning and the appropriateness of the servant leader approach to the Kenyan context. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The social returns include economic development of distressed urban and rural geographies; creation of high-quality jobs for low-income populations; building wealth for women and people of color; and creation of products that benefit society, such as those that lower poverty or contribute to a cleaner environment. This article introduces a conceptual framework for the developmental venture capital industry based on the social objectives of individual funds. The framework distinguishes between funds that have corrective versus additive objectives. Funds with corrective objectives are designed to address inadequate access to traditional venture capital by specific geographies and populations. Funds with additive objectives are meant to further specific social goals, such as fighting poverty or environmental degradation. This framework further differentiates between two forms of corrective venture capital, based on the capital access obstacles that each is trying to address and whether the resulting economic models require subsidy.},

A transaction cost analysis (economic) argument is used to rationalize the importance for entrepreneurs to effectively manage these two uncertainty factors when implementing a direct marketing program. This is illustrated using a perceptual mapping of each direct marketing channel relative to the two uncertainty dimensions. Design/methodology/approach – The paper is organized by first presenting a brief description of each direct marketing strategy relative to its use by entrepreneurs in a non-profit business environment. These strategies include: online, direct mail, catalogue, direct response, telephone marketing, and personal selling. Each strategy is then compared via their placement on a perceptual map using the two uncertainty dimensions: cost of implementation and control over direct marketing resources. Findings – With the increasing prevalence of social entrepreneurship where the goal is to maximize returns given limited resources, this framework can become a critical tool to help nonprofit business owners first assess and then reduce the risks and uncertainties of their direct marketing strategies. Originality/value – The conceptual framework presented is the one of few that addresses the issue of risk management among direct marketing strategies in social entrepreneurship. This can provide the basis for further research in this area to empirically validate and operationalized this framework. © 2007, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

In this context, research findings focusing on community involvement initiatives that have taken place within general practices, Primary Care Groups (PCGs) and Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) are explored and the key issues for implementation are appraised. Using an evaluation of a team set up to foster community involvement with the PCTs in Bradford, the utility of a social entrepreneurship approach is considered. It is argued that this form of approach can be employed as a means of utilizing the work of existing groups and operating in a 'joined up' way. It is further contended that an emphasis on process and on social entrepreneurship can foster the development of community involvement practices in Primary Care Trusts to meet the current and changing health needs of local communities. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.},

abstract={Two seemingly separate disciplines, social entrepreneurship and sustainable microfinance, have both matured and converged over the past two decades, so that the latter has become a dramatic example of the successful application of the former. Sustainable microfinance demonstrates that banks and commercially oriented NGOs can "do well by doing good": they can generate considerable profit while at the same time have a significant positive development impact. Sustainable microfinance institutions are innovative creators of social value in that they pursue business opportunities where financial performance and social impact complement rather than compete with each other. They apply conventional banking precepts in an unconventional manner, creating commercially viable financial institutions that double as social change agents. Despite the many opportunities presented by scaling down or scaling up, there is still a vital role for non-commercialized microfinance. It is essential to match the appropriate institutional model, whether a bank, finance company, membership-based organization, or subsidized NGO, with the microfinance organization's mission. The guiding principles should be institutional diversification, product differentiation, and market segmentation.},

abstract={While social entrepreneurship (SE) as a field of study has progressed some distance over the past four decades, it is plagued by many unanswered, yet fundamental, questions. The SE literature is filled with an abundance of disputes, controversies, and alternative perspectives. Although this can suggest a healthy and robust discipline, it can also raise questions regarding the legitimacy and relevancy of the field, and uncertainty regarding where it is headed. In this research, we provide a systematic overview of major unresolved issues characterizing the contemporary study of SE in the form of thirteen divides. These divides cover such issues as social value creation, social innovation, nature of the process, agents, entrepreneurial orientation, scalability, venture creation, revenue sources, organizational outcomes, efficacy, and the appropriate disciplinary home. Rather than taking sides on each divide, we discuss how these diverse perspectives can be accommodated based on the process perspective. We present an inclusive approach to SE that provides a common platform for advancing the field while allowing for diverse streams of research. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Social finance and banking with an embedded social purpose have been on the rise in recent decades. Social entrepreneurs have repeatedly stressed the critical need for financial support from social banks. This study aims to provide a bibliometric analysis of the status of the field in social finance and banking, recognising main topics from existing research and establishing future re-search challenges. Our study used science mapping workflow and multiple research questions to investigate the broad literature about social banking and finance. With in-depth bibliometric analysis, authors examined qualitative and quantitative variables as primary research infor-mation, relevant sources, subject areas, authors data, social, thematic and intellectual structure. The data was retrieved from Web of Science (WOS) and then analysed using Bibliometrix R-package. The analysis was based on a sample of 270 articles and demonstrates a multidisciplinary vision of the research flow investigated. Our results show several insights regarding journals, authors and geographical interest of this research stream. Specifically, the literature, although dwelling on social finance and banking, includes five theoretical and practical clusters as (1) people’s well-being, combined with technological innovation, (2) governance, (3) ethical investment and sustainable development, (4) corporate social responsibility (CSR), and (5) transparency. The authors also note a line of research that observes technological solutions for the response to social and environmental problems. These results may be useful for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to foster social finance and financial system tools. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

This article takes college students’ social entrepreneurs as research objects, drawing on Krueger’s model, theory of planned behavior, social cognitive theory, and triadic reciprocal determinism theory. This paper constructs a conceptual model with emotional ability, entrepreneurial self-efficacy, and entrepreneurial intention, to further study their relationship. The 312 students from China College Students’ Social Entrepreneurship Project engaged in early entrepreneurship practice, conducted a questionnaire survey and used the empirical test of the structural equation model to analyze the relationship between college students’ emotional competences, entrepreneurial self-efficacy, and entrepreneurial intention. The result show: First, social–emotional competence had a positive effect on entrepreneurial intention, and the positive effect of personal affective competence on entrepreneurial intention was not supported or only partially supported. Second, all the dimensions of entrepreneurial self-efficacy were significantly and positively correlated with entrepreneurial intention. Third, emotional competence has a significant positive impact on entrepreneurial self-efficacy. Fourth, entrepreneurial self-efficacy mediated the relationship between emotional competence and entrepreneurial intention. © Copyright © 2020 Chien-Chi, Sun, Yang, Zheng and Li.},

abstract={The concept of social entrepreneurship (SE) is gaining attention in developing economies for the purpose of greater societal welfare maximization. Still, findings in the field of SE studies have been riddled with conflicting results and counterstatement. Also, the determinants of developing SE are not robustly investigated in developing economies like Bangladesh. This context has mobilized the authors of this current study to focus on determining student's intention to pursue SE as their career choice. Hence, the study aims to examine the predictive determinants of social entrepreneurial intentions (SEI) among Bangladeshi students. The study has investigated the influence of entrepreneurial self-efficacy, social support, prior experience, and educational support on SEI. The survey was conducted from a public university of Bangladesh, and 231 students participated in the study. Questionnaire items under each construct variable have been adopted from pre-tested research studies. Five-point Likert scale questionnaire was applied to measure the variables. SPSS version 23.0 has been used for statistical analysis through which correlation and multiple regression analysis were conducted to measure the impact of the independent variables on SEI. Results exhibited that self-efficacy, social support, and educational support positively and significantly predicted SEI, while prior experience does not influence SEI. © The Author(s).},

abstract={Background: WHO recommends that men who have sex with men (MSM) receive gonorrhoea and chlamydia testing, but many evidence-based preventive services are unaffordable. The pay-it-forward strategy offers an individual a gift (eg, a test for sexually transmitted diseases) and then asks whether they would like to give a gift (eg, a future test) to another person. This study examined the effectiveness of a pay-it-forward programme to increase gonorrhoea and chlamydia testing among MSM in China. Methods: We did a randomised controlled superiority trial at three HIV testing sites run by MSM community-based organisations in Guangzhou and Beijing, China. We included MSM aged 16 years or older who were seeking HIV testing and met indications for gonorrhoea and chlamydia testing. Restricted randomisation was done using computer-generated permuted blocks. 30 groups were randomised into three arms (1:1:1): a pay-it-forward arm in which men were offered free gonorrhoea and chlamydia testing and then asked whether they would like to donate for testing of prospective participants, a pay-what-you-want arm in which men were offered free testing and given the option to pay any desired amount for the test, and a standard-of-care arm in which testing was offered at ¥150 (US$22). There was no masking to arm assignment. The primary outcome was gonorrhoea and chlamydia test uptake ascertained by administrative records. We used generalised estimating equations to estimate intervention effects with one-sided 95% CIs and a prespecified superiority margin of 20%. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03741725. Findings: Between Dec 8, 2018, and Jan 19, 2019, 301 men were recruited and included in the analysis. 101 were randomly assigned to the pay-it-forward group, 100 to the pay-what-you-want group, and 100 to the standard-of-care group. Test uptake for gonorrhoea and chlamydia was 56% (57 of 101 participants) in the pay-it-forward arm, 46% (46 of 100 participants) in the pay-what-you-want arm, and 18% (18 of 100 participants) in the standard-of-care arm. The estimated difference in test uptake between the pay-it-forward and standard-of-care group was 38·4% (95% CI lower bound 28·4%). Among men in the pay-it-forward arm, 54 of 57 (95%) chose to donate to support testing for others. Interpretation: The pay-it-forward strategy can increase gonorrhoea and chlamydia testing uptake among Chinese MSM and could be a useful tool for scaling up preventive services that carry a mandatory fee.

Moreover, the findings suggest a positive relationship between proactiveness and value co-creation mediated by market orientation.

We show that the social mission fostered a shared identity that guided the search for adaptations to the franchise model. The shared mission-driven identity created pressure toward (1) decentralized decision-making, (2) shared governance, and (3) a role for the franchisor as orchestrator of collaborative knowledge sharing among franchisees.

abstract={Research on social entrepreneurship (SE) has increased exponentially during the past decade. Even though this social phenomenon has aroused the interest of researchers, many aspects have not yet been fully studied. In this study, the goal is to analyze how the factors that define the behavior of social entrepreneurs are affected by the perception that they have about the development of the social enterprise sector (SES development). We perform an empirical multivariable analysis using 2015 Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) data related to SE, with an international sample that contains information of 17,778 entrepreneurs, of which 6470 are social entrepreneurs. The empirical analysis is carried out applying binary response models, introducing interaction terms to analyze the moderating effect of SES development. Our results show that the entrepreneurs' perception of the SES development exerts a moderating effect over three different groups of factors: 1) factors related to self-perception about entrepreneurship (including values, perceptions, and entrepreneurial skills); 2) demographic factors (gender, age, and education level), and 3) context and entrepreneurial environment (including factors related to entrepreneurs' perception of societal values, entrepreneurship environment, and economic development). This moderating effect has very important implications, especially for policymakers. Our results show that SES development could amplify some effects, both positively and negatively. Therefore, the design and implementation of policies to support SE must consider the moderating role of this variable on the entrepreneurial behavior, because it could affect the effectiveness of such policies. © 2020 by the author.},

abstract={In order to promote sustainable entrepreneurship, it is necessary to understand the sustainable entrepreneurial process. To address this gap in the literature, this study aims to investigate how entrepreneurs generate ideas, as well as recognize, develop, and exploit opportunities in the context of sustainable development. A case study was carried out with eleven organizations in six different countries, from diffferent sectors, including not-for-profit and for-profit businesses. The findings address a series of mechanisms that occur prior to the process of generating an idea and are relevant to the positive impact of these businesses on society. Entrepreneurs' previous experiences and skills, as well as the knowledge of similar initiatives, strongly relate to motivation and idea generation. In the analyzed cases, prior experience seemed to be related to a sensitivity towards a social or environmental problem. Previous experience in entrepreneurship was not determinant. The quality of the initial idea was relevant, once little changes occurred throughout the entire process. In most situations both dimensions of sustainability were integrated at the same time and before venture launch. Despite this, the focus of the entrepreneurs was on only one dimension. The inclusion of positive impact measurement on society, as part of the sustainable entrepreneurial process model, is another relevant finding. First, it is necessary to differentiate the sustainable entrepreneur from the regular and the social entrepreneur. Secondly, in some situations, the dimensions of sustainability are not integrated at the same time and before venture launch, and therefore considering that the process is finished in the phase of venture launch can lead to misclassifications. The results also led to the recognition of triggers that can stimulate sustainable entrepreneurship, such as educational practices more aligned with sustainability problems faced by local communities, stronger dissemination of successful business cases related to sustainability in other countries and contexts, integration between universities and businesses, and the inclusion of practice-based learning in curricula. A contribution to the literature was achieved by providing a systemic perspective on sustainable entrepreneurial process. This study also contributes by presenting empirical evidence of the phenomenon of sustainable entrepreneurship. The holistic knowledge of this process provides new information that supports academics, policy makers, government, and individuals with a more appropriate understanding of the conditions that help to stimulate new business activities dealing with economic, social, and environmental problems faced in society, helping to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={In this article, we utilize 25 years of data on the Milwaukee voucher program to test the relationships among organizational liabilities of newness, institutional affiliation, market-share, and regulatory environment on the cumulative risk of school failure. Overall, we find that 41 percent of all private voucher schools operating in Milwaukee between 1991 and 2015 failed. Start-up voucher schools, and those unaffiliated with a larger institution, have comparatively higher failure risk over time. The results of our analysis shed light onto one of the long-term impacts of a public policy reform premised on social entrepreneurship. We conclude that policymakers should consider the consequences of organizational failure when utilizing nongovernment entities in the provision of public goods, and that scholars focus increased attention to understanding the negative externalities created by public entrepreneurship. © 2016 Policy Studies Organization},

This study explored the antecedents and their influences on the social entrepreneurial intentions (SEIs) of NPO workers. Two sets of samples were collected through online surveys. First, 200 samples were used for exploratory factor analysis, and subsequently, 602 samples were used to establish a structural equation model. The results revealed that the involved antecedents partially influenced SEIs through social entrepreneurial (SE) creativity. The originality aspects of SE creativity demonstrated dominant positive effects on both the SE conviction and the SE preparation of SEIs, followed by cognitive empathy and bonding social capital. The stockholder perspective of social responsibility and affective empathy negatively affected both the conviction and preparation of SEIs. The stakeholder perspective of social responsibility and the usefulness aspect of SE creativity demonstrated minor positive effects on SE conviction. We suggest that NPO leaders keep an open mind to business strategies and focus on SE originality, cognitive empathy, and bonding social capital when developing talent for future achievement. © 2019, International Society for Third-Sector Research and The Johns Hopkins University.},

On the basis of the configuration theory, this study investigates how SE, CE, and three-pillar institutions work together effectively to promote social well-being. We use the fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis to investigate the substitution and complementarity mechanisms for achieving high social well-being among 23 economies. This study reconciles the contradictory results in the extant literature regarding whether SE and CE, SE and government activism, CE and postmaterialism, and government activism and postmaterialism are complements or substitutes in promoting social well-being. Our work shows that the complementarity and substitution between these factors can coexist depending on the social context of the given society. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

The social enterprises take substantial financial risks although carefully avoid anything that may jeopardise the firms’ social impact. They exhibit highly innovative behaviour when developing new ways to serve the social purpose as well as when finding new ways to generate income. Furthermore, these enterprises exhibit remarkable persistence in adhering to a course of action despite their experienced difficulties. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

abstract={The concept of social entrepreneurship has not reached full understanding in almost all developing countries, specifically in Pakistan. Social entrepreneurship is an outstanding social vehicle that, if adopted, can transform a society by resolving its social, economic, and environmental issues with the help of homemade solutions for social problems. The phenomena of social entrepreneurship rarely exist in Pakistan, due to a lack of research in and awareness of the field. So far, no quantitative or qualitative research has been conducted on the subject area of social entrepreneurship. Thus, the prime objective of this study is to investigate the effect of personal factors (human capital, social capital, motivational factors) on the development of social entrepreneurial ventures in Pakistan. This research study has investigated the interaction effect of the collaboration of quadruple helix sectors on the factors that affect the development of social entrepreneurial ventures in Pakistan. Quadruple Helix Innovation Theory (QHIT) explains that the economic development of a country stands on four pillars: university, industry, government, and civil society. In this research, a quantitative research approach has been adopted by using a survey questionnaire. This research study has used convenience sampling to select a sample from the target population for collecting answers from respondents who were conveniently available. The population of this study includes all of the social entrepreneurs operating in two important cities (Bahawalpur, Multan) of southern Punjab, Pakistan. SmartPLS 3 was utilized to analyze the data. Moderation has been tested using the bootstrapping technique in SmartPLS software. It is found that human capital, social capital, and motivational factors have a significant positive relationship with social entrepreneurship. Moreover, quadruple helix sectors moderate the relationship between personal factors (human capital, social capital, motivational factors) and social entrepreneurship. The study provides a road map for the development of social entrepreneurship in Pakistan as a solution to social problems. © 2018 by the authors.},

We enrich the discussion on how to reconcile conflicting logics in hybrid organisations using the analogy with music theory. In particular, we get inspiration from a technique used to modulate conflicting harmonies by means of the notes they have in common (common-notes) to derive ideas on how to compose conflicting logics by means of the practices they have in common. We illustrate these ideas in the specific case of social enterprises, showing that practices able to ‘unblock’ a marginalised individual’s value creation capabilities can be considered common-note practices allowing the social enterprise to fruitfully and sustainably combine commercial and social welfare logics. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Background: Entrepreneurship has undergone significant transformations in the past decade due to crowd-based models of innovation and the increasing popularity of crowdfunding. Crowdfunding provides an alternative to the way entrepreneurs traditionally raise start-up and operational funds for a venture. Moreover, with crowdfunding platforms, citizens and communities are increasingly able to engage in entrepreneurial work not only for profit but also to address social and civic problems. Problem: Given the expanding boundaries of entrepreneurship, it is increasingly important for professional and technical communication teachers to prepare students to be ethical entrepreneurs and embody a widening array of rhetorical skills. Our teaching case addresses the question of how we might incorporate new and emerging forms of entrepreneurship, such as crowdfunding, into the professional and technical communication classroom in ways that foreground the social, civic, and ethical dimensions of that work. Situating the case: To address this question, we first situate our teaching case in relevant literature from professional and technical communication and social entrepreneurship, and then compare it with similar cases of crowdfunding being used for educational purposes. How the case was studied: We describe what we observed before, during, and after teaching a project structured thematically around civic crowdfunding. We had two sources of data: (1) a collection of teaching materials, including syllabi, day-to-day lesson plans, project prompts, in-class activities, correspondence between instructors, and informal teaching logs used to record impromptu reflections throughout the course of the semester; and (2) the civic crowdfunding project materials produced by students. About the case: Two distinct but related problems have motivated the development of this teaching case: (1) the context of 21st-century entrepreneurship has rapidly changed as a result of new approaches, including crowdfunding; (2) this shift has also led to an increased emphasis on civic and social matters of concern, which have increasingly become more important in contemporary business models. Ultimately, we seek to understand how entrepreneurial writing projects can meld commercial and financial motivations with civic exigencies, direct participation, and stakeholder engagement. As such, this civic crowdfunding sequence takes place over two phases: (1) students conducted primary and secondary research on a local problem or exigency and used this as evidence for a white paper and a project proposal; (2) students developed a feasible solution to this problem which then formed the basis for crowdfunding campaign materials, including a Kickstarter page, campaign video, and branding materials. Results: Our results focus on two projects that clearly foreground a social and civic mission; we point to these two projects not as perfect examples, but rather as illustrative cases of how students engaged crowdfunding as a form of civic entrepreneurship. Conclusions: Our teaching case has demonstrated the need to prepare students not only to pitch venture ideas for a small audience of investors, but also to consider how to identify and frame problems, construct stories about these problems as pressing matters of concern and, ultimately, develop ethical relationships with stakeholders and increasingly diverse investors. © 1988-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={An increasing body of research has applied an institutional perspective to understand actors’ responses to conflicting institutional logics and the creation process of new organizational forms.

Moreover, we find it is insufficient to apply current frameworks, which have been mainly driven by studies conducted in Western contexts, to study actors’ responses to institutional multiplicity in China, especially in its emerging non-profit sector. This article fills research gaps by providing an in-depth case analysis of the creation and legitimation process of the One Foundation -the first independent charity foundation established by civic individuals in China. Our study shows that the coexisting and competing relationship among state, civil society, social mission, and market logics provides impetus for organizational change and innovation. This article theorizes a temporal model by showing that actors seek provisional solutions in different organizational stages and gradually develop capabilities to progress institutional work from individual to organizational and to societal level to achieve their goals. By showing how a charity foundation plays a role as a change agent, this article also sheds light on the condition and process that drive innovation in China’s non-profit sector. © 2016 The International Association for Chinese Management Research},

A survey of 1,080 students attending different disciplines in 14 UAE public and private universities reveals a gap between entrepreneurial desire and preparedness. About 38 and 23.3% expressed an interest in becoming entrepreneurs and social entrepreneurs, respectively. Despite this level of interest, the limited access to social entrepreneurship education, training and experience leads to a drive–preparedness gap that must be reduced in order to maximise the potential of the UAE’s next generation. Integrating social entrepreneurship as part of the university entrepreneurship education programmes can ensure that the future business entrepreneurs are more socially conscious. © 2016 The Author(s).},

Our focus is an 'informal rural social cooperative' of more than 20 women entrepreneurs led by 48 years old homemaker turned entrepreneur 'Annie'. Employing a broad narratological framework to collect and analyse stories of lived experiences, we built a large textual data record of 'Annie's Co-op' for a period of 12 months. The 'thick' findings indicate that within their rural business venture, the participants play important roles as breadwinners for their families and as social entrepreneurs for their community; acting as one unit they demonstrate not just strategies of resilience but also a spirit of social duty despite barriers and challenges to their entrepreneurialism.

The three types of corporate social entrepreneurship: corporate social entrepreneurship as local development tool, corporate social entrepreneurship as market development tool, and corporate social entrepreneurship as transformational innovation tool were organised as the alternatives of a carefully constructed hierarchy having as criteria: return on investment (which does not necessarily refer to the money that the company invests in the strategy; the term is derived from sustainability and scalability), degree of novelty, pre-entry knowledge and interest in solving the communities’ social problems. The questionnaire constructed based on the hierarchy using analytic hierarchy processes was distributed to experts (business developers) coming from the following industries or sectors: beverages, IT, banking, furniture, and automotive. The research reveals which is the approach most likely to be employed by Romanian business developers. The results may be inferred to the sum of businesses represented by the expert business developers who were part of the research. © 2015, Editura Economica. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Abstract: Social enterprises seek resource combinations to provide some assurance of sustainability as they create social value in a defined domain of action. However, this resource-seeking mandate also constitutes a distraction that complicates the operations of any social enterprise. How do social enterprises manage the implicit duality of maintaining a commercial mission in order to achieve their social mission? Using the context of South Africa, this study examines the process trade-offs that enhance or limit social impact under the referenced duality. The study clarifies the nature of these trade-offs, as a basis for appropriating efficiency-enhancing process design in enterprises that create, but do not capture value. The author proposes a unique intersection between the logic of control and the logic of empowerment in the field of social entrepreneurship, and suggests that value chain processes be controlled to the extent that the enterprise acts as a custodian of community empowerment for its target beneficiaries. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

Social entrepreneurship courses have a growing presence in U. S. public affairs programs, but the content of these courses has not yet been mapped. For this paper, we reviewed 16 syllabi from courses taught in U. S. schools of public affairs and administration, largely from schools ranked in the top 30 nationwide in 2012 by U. S. News & World Report. We identified patterns in program approaches, course content, and evaluation methods in order to offer information to others who may be teaching these classes now or in the near future. We conclude that the confluence of values, skills, and knowledge offered by public affairs programs is highly relevant to students who endeavor to be social entrepreneurs or intrapreneurs at any level of government or nonprofit organization. © 2015, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to report on a study aimed at understanding the different conceptions that University of Northampton teachers hold of “Changemaker”, an institutional initiative to develop capacities for social innovation. Design/methodology/approach – The study took a phenomenographic approach to identify a small number of qualitatively different conceptions of Changemaker among teaching staff. Face-to-face, phenomenographic interviews were carried out with 30 teachers across the university. Transcript data were analysed using thematic inductive analysis. Findings – Five different conceptions of Changemaker were found: Changemaker as university strategy; Changemaker as critical thinking, perspective shifting and problem solving; Changemaker as employability; Changemaker as social betterment; and Changemaker as personal transformation. Research limitations/implications – The outcome space of conceptions represents the beliefs of teaching staff at the University of Northampton. The approach to research and plans for the practical application of findings may be of direct benefit to other education providers as they develop their own models for teaching and learning. Practical implications – The findings from this study will inform the next phase of the project, which involves the development of a skills/attributes/behaviours matrix for social innovation education. Social implications – An initiative, such as Changemaker, works to enhance the capacities of university students to work as agents of positive social change. By building a research programme around this initiative, the findings from this work can be disseminated and used by other higher education institutions. Originality/value – The findings of this study will address the absence of literature on teachers’ conceptions of phenomena related to social innovation, social entrepreneurship and intrepreneurship. Understanding teachers’ beliefs of such phenomena is relevant to the growing number of universities that address these subjects in the curriculum. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

This article focuses on social entrepreneurs, by aiming to identify their main motivations in the founding and development of a social enterprise, as well as the main challenges faced in their social entrepreneurial activity in a constantly changing business environment. The paper presents a qualitative research conducted on Romanian social entrepreneurs. The results, interpreted through content analysis, indicate that social entrepreneurs, unlike business entrepreneurs, are not profit-driven, but mission driven, their main objective being to make a difference in the society and have a positive impact in the local communities. Furthermore, the research revealed specific challenges faced by Romanian social entrepreneurs, as well as specific differences between social and business entrepreneurs, who aim strictly achieving economic performance. Considering the limitations and future research directions, the implications of the findings are discussed, the paper outlining a profile of the social entrepreneur that can be useful to the public sector for the development of policies aimed at enhancing this type of entrepreneurship, in a constantly changing social environment.},

abstract={As a result of the bad economic situation and the infrastructural deficits in structurally weak rural regions of Europe, a downward spiral has started and ever more people are moving away, thus further reducing the economic opportunities of these regions. The support of such regions typically happens through top-down approaches, for example, by EU programs. All too often, however, experience has shown that such projects come to a halt when funding ends because the support needed from local actors was insufficient to bring on further development. Meanwhile, top-down approaches, such as the EU LEADER initiative, are building on this insight. The ideal of including committed citizens, however, is being confronted with a sobering reality: Often these groups suffer from a lack of institutional embeddedness, know-how, professionalism and necessary reputation.Against this background, social entrepreneurs might be helpful in empowering civil society actors. Social entrepreneurs are key figures who, through an entrepreneurial approach, develop and implement innovative solutions for social problems. These actors may be seen as intermediaries acting at the interface of policy measures and local citizen engagement. In this contribution, I will deal with the initiatives of social entrepreneurs who are particularly breaking new ground in the field of regional development - an item that has not yet been discussed in literature. On the basis of an exploratory study, I will analyze four selected projects in Europe (Spain and Germany) where social entrepreneurs started bottom-up initiatives in regional development. In this context, I will mainly pursue the questions of how the entrepreneurs managed to do this, that is, how they addressed existing problems, how they acted, how their (innovative) projects worked, and what implications their projects have for socio-spatial development. It will be shown how social entrepreneurs try to empower (entrepreneurial) citizens by providing help for self-help, particularly by way of educational offers, counseling and coaching, and by supporting citizens to establish useful contacts and social networks; not least by organizing financial means, usually in the form of micro-loans. © 2014 ETH - Eidenössiche Technische Hochschule Zürich.},

abstract={Social business and social entrepreneurship offer an exciting field for empirical and conceptual management research. Yet, while there are many attempts to define either social entrepreneurship or social business, the boundaries and overlaps of both phenomena often remain vague or contested -thus rendering empirical or conceptual learning more difficult. We propose a three-dimensional definitional framework to define social business and social entrepreneurship, distinguish them, and relate them to each other. Our framework interprets the pure forms of both social business and social entrepreneurship as the two-dimensional combination of a pure social mission with either pure financial self-sustainability (social business) or a pure innovation focus (social entrepreneurship). Since the finance and innovation perspective are distinct yet independent dimensions, we derive and illustrate four cases of how social business and social entrepreneurship may but need not overlap. Challenging the assumption that each dimension is confined to two dichotomous values, we then interpret each dimension as a full spectrum and introduce the idea of mission, finance, and innovation hybridity. Our discussion suggests that multidimensional hybridity is the empirical rule rather than the exception. It is for this reason that the study of the pure forms of social business and social entrepreneurship promises particularly fruitful insights for management research. We conclude with implications for future management research. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. All rights are reserved.},

abstract={There has been proliferation of endowments, foundations, NGOs and other organisations operating within many developing countries over the past 20 years as social entrepreneurs/enterprises. These organisations have been supporting and working in developing countries, attempting to transform the quality of lives of their beneficiaries; essentially creating social value. While there is evidence on output and outcome from programmes, there is little evidence of meaningful, sustained impact and hence effectiveness, despite millions of dollars being spent. The lack of this evidence begs the question of the justification for continued funding, state benefits and tax exemptions for the programmes. Additionally, it raises the issue of sustainability of the intervention process, given that the primary source of funding for many of these organisations is grants and/or philanthropic contributions. The paper adopts the Ashoka Foundation's lead, which measures sustainability/vulnerability of supporting organisations and the effectiveness of these entities in creating and sustaining social value. It employs Kushner's Model of 'An Open Systems Model of Organisational Effectiveness' to inform the empirical methodology and develops the instrument used. It furthers the process by employing regression analysis in identifying the significant variables in determining organizational effectiveness. The results show that the organisations 'Ability to Adapt' and 'Resource Adequacy' are significant determinants for organizational effectiveness. The results thus present meaningful insights for funders (foundations, endowments, corporations), policy makers and organizations on how they can improve their effectiveness and justify the financial support they received from their donors.},

While social entrepreneurship is not a new phenomenon, in the last 15 years, it is growing extensively with a new breed of entrepreneur developing solutions to social problems. This paper brings insight of creating a successful business model in social entrepreneurship with the help of the case. The case is about a European international company, Vestergaard Frandsen, which specialises in disease control along with complex emergency response products. This company is directed by a unique humanitarian entrepreneurship business model in which humanitarian responsibility is in its core business and their business model is based on 'profit for purpose'. This organisation is involved in innovating products and concepts which are more useful for the developing world. This separates them from other companies who innovate for developed countries which are wealthier regions of the world and then adapt it for other developing countries. This paper focuses on how social entrepreneurship can extend boundaries and function in different countries.

abstract={Purpose - The purpose of this study is to assess the current prevalence of empirical research in the field of social entrepreneurship. Further, we identify secondary datasets and explain their relative strengths and weaknesses for use by social entrepreneurship scholars. Methods - The authors conducted a search of academic articles in the EBSCO and ProQuest databases mentioning social entrepreneurship, social venture(s), social enterprise(s), or social entrepreneur(s) in the title, abstract, or keywords published from 2009 to 2013. Papers were coded and analyzed based upon the nature of their methods. Findings - We find that while qualitative studies are still the norm, quantitative methods are increasing, thanks to the creation of large-scale datasets and the use of analysis techniques new to the field. Three such large-scale datasets - the PSED II, GEM, and nonprofit tax collections - are discussed in depth. We find several strengths and weaknesses for each dataset, yet each provides social entrepreneurship scholars with fruitful opportunities. Value of chapter - Through a deeper understanding of empirical research and sources of social entrepreneurship data, scholars may be more attracted to social entrepreneurship, better equipped to conduct high-quality research and publish in high-quality outlets. Moreover, by moving beyond case studies and small-sample research to engaging larger pools of subjects and producing more generalizable findings, social entrepreneurship scholars will have the ability to impact a much broader scope of practitioners. © 2014 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The issue of social entrepreneurship got immense importance in the eyes of the researchers recently. Moreover, data are very limited in the context of Malaysia especially for Muslim entrepreneurs. Realizing these current needs and trends, this study aimed at understanding the current level of practice of social entrepreneurship among the Muslim entrepreneurs in Malaysia. This study has conducted total five in-depth interviews of various Muslim social entrepreneurs to reveal the entrepreneurial dimension that is prevailing in the non-profit organizations. Moreover, this study addresses the research gap and proposes a model of social entrepreneurship for Muslim social entrepreneurs. To end with, this study summarized that, social enterprises have a valuable role to play in creating and sustaining civil society, the benefits of which are consumed by the whole of society. It is in society's interest therefore to ensure that their contribution in this respect is protected. © IDOSI Publications, 2013.},

Organizations pursuing social entrepreneurship must manage based on the need to 'do no harm' across all three tenets of sustainability: social equity, economic prosperity, and environmental integrity. These three tenets may be in conflict with each other, but organizations that pursue social entrepreneurship must manage with all three of them in mind across a wide range of stakeholders. Extending research on managing organizational fitness in rugged fitness landscapes, this paper argues that social entrepreneurship organizations will need to engage in substantial search processes, will face particularly difficult challenges in managing goals and initiatives, and will need to move into environmental search and adaptive modes early in their maturation process. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

This article adds to the discussion by describing how agents at three different case study sites perceive how their organizations generate SVC. The three sites represent special aspects of social activity: a private elementary school; a religious mental health clinic; and a public child services center. An Interactive Qualitative Analysis (IQA) tool was modified to capture case study agents' perceptions of how their organizations created their intended social value. Use of this process produced underlying organizational themes or affinities found in the respective organization's outcomes. The analysis of these affinities generated a visual depiction of processes typically hidden to the agents of the organizations, but revealed a much clearer description of SVC and opportunities for organizational improvement. The modified IQA process described in this research revealed that social value creation may be outside of organizational goals and outcomes.},

Human resource development (HRD) in developing countries has scopes and applications beyond economic interests; it often involves addressing social issues.Furthermore, the continuing trend of population growth in the developing world, coupled with limited or unavailable resources and infrastructure, has created additional challenges. As a result, HRD practitioners in the developing world must become more innovative change agents. The Solution. This article introduces the concept of "social entrepreneurship" into HRD and urges HRD practitioners to partner with social entrepreneurs in their mission of promoting communit and national development. Specifically, I draw details from four well-known case examples in two emerging economics-India and China-to demonstrate how social entrepreneurs have used HRD and organization development strategies to address societal problems in these two countries.

abstract={The fundamental premise of social entrepreneurship is to use business knowledge to solve critical economic, social and environmental dilemmas facing a society. Social entrepreneurship is an emerging theme of inquiry in contemporary business, entrepreneurship, marketing and ethics literature. In effect, social entrepreneurs are concerned with making a "mission-related impact" which becomes their central concern. To date, there has been little attention given to the notion of social entrepreneurship in the discipline of tourism. Despite the lack of attention in tourism research there have been a number of significant social entrepreneurial contributions made to various communities in South Africa. Such contributions demonstrate the significance of change makers in the context of rural South Africa signifying progress in the country's new democracy. This paper is a consequence of two phases of field work in South Africa over a 10- month period. The paper discusses the motivational behaviour of six Fair Trade Tourism South Africa (FTTSA) entrepreneurs who have developed businesses with the intention of giving back to their South African communities. However, the study employed critical discourse analysis and in so doing it recognizes some of the inherent contradictions in informants' discourses based on their white privilege experienced during apartheid. Two aims focused on this exploration: 1) to seek information regarding entrepreneurial stimuli for involvement in social action, through FTTSA membership, and 2) to investigate FTTSA members' micro and macro discourses that inform their actions and behaviours. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.},

This has resulted in both opportunities for and constraints on human services practice and community participation. In this article, the terminology and the conceptual frames associated with work both in and with communities are critically scrutinized. However, it is also contended that spatial analysis and social entrepreneurship can enable those working in the field to respond productively to the New Public Management and 'Third Way' approaches that have shaped the policy context of human services practice. It is argued that a form of spatial analysis and of social entrepreneurship can be used to facilitate meaningful participation in decision-making processes in a variety of communities and to re-forge social connections at a range of levels. © 2009 The Australian Sociological Association.},

journal={AHURI Final Report},
year={2009},
number={134},
pages={1-197},
url={https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84907583406&partnerID=40&md5=0d29069e0fdfb282bbe912d9e771ed40},

abstract={The organisations studied Within Australias highly diversified not-for-profit housing system, the focus of this study is on those housing providers that are, or are considering, undertaking more financing and development of their own housing. In the study such organisations are defined as having: A social goal to provide well located housing that is affordable for a range of low to moderate income households; Financial capacity to secure their own housing finance and assets; Organisational capacity and skills to initiate, develop and maintain a portfolio of housing assets; and A strategic intent to operate at a scale that would be sufficient to generate additional housing production on a regular basis, to achieve operational efficiencies and to help to generate further innovative responses to defined housing needs.
The purpose and context of the research This study investigates the policy environment and accomplishments of emerging not-for-profit housing developers in Australia. The core purpose is to understand the current operating environment of these agencies and to identify directions for policy that could enable these or similar organisations to make larger scale contributions to the provision of affordable housing in Australia. The report of the research builds on and updates a previous AHURI funded study of the engagement of not-for-profit organisations in developing affordable housing, which was completed in 2004 (Milligan et al. 2004). This follow-up study offers a timely opportunity to assess progress in policy and practice against the benchmarks and proposed directions laid down in the earlier research. A key question is how far Australia has come in establishing a viable and sustainable not-for-profit affordable housing industry and what additional policy effort will be required. The time period examined covers 2004 to early 2009, with most data collection being undertaken in 2008. That period has been marked by significant developments in the funding, policy, regulatory and delivery frameworks for affordable housing in Australia, commencing with changes led mainly by state and territory jurisdictions followed by a suite of national initiatives since 2008. As this study was being finalised, the market and policy contexts impacting on affordable housing providers were shifting rapidly, under the influence of both global financial and economic conditions and local changes in policy guided by the Council of Australian Governments. This was also a period of deepening affordability problems. While many factors contribute to housing affordability trends, supply side aspects, including the availability of land; land development processes and policies; infrastructure costs; the costs of construction; and property related taxes are recognised widely as key components. The first annual report of the Australian Governments newly established National Housing Supply Council identified an effective shortage of 251,000 private rental dwellings in 2008 in Australia (Australian Government 2009). In this context, this report, like its predecessor and other associated research by the authors and Gilmour (2009), provides another important benchmark for monitoring what can be characterised as an emerging affordable housing industry in Australia.
Scope and methodology For this update, relevant policy developments were assessed for all jurisdictions in Australia. Primary research was also conducted in all states and territories, with emphasis given to those regions where housing associations are most active as developers of housing projects. The study also has an international dimension. In Australia, the main methods used to collect empirical information included surveys of provider organisations; interviews with organisational staff, stakeholders, partners and other key informants; group discussions with tenants of affordable housing projects; and analysis of a variety of key documents and websites of governments and relevant organisations. International research involved an update of previous research by some of the authors (Lawson and Milligan 2007, Gurran et al. 2008) and closer examination of case studies in Austria, Switzerland, France and the Netherlands that offered innovative financing and regulatory policies or cautionary tales of potential relevance to Australia. The European based member of the research team, Dr Julie Lawson, carried out local field work, talking directly to key informants based in government, peak housing organisations, individual provider organisations and financing institutions across those four countries during 2008.
Overall In response to the ultimate research question posed of this study-what new approaches would improve the operating environment for affordable housing services in Australia?-our study finds that the key next step is bringing together, harmonising and sustaining the disparate elements of innovative practice in Australia under one coordinated national framework for policy setting, funding, regulation and capacity building. The achievements of the fledgling not-for-profit affordable housing industry to date suggest that significant public policy benefits and highly positive outcomes for tenants will result from building a well designed, well funded, well regulated and well maintained affordable housing policy model that utilises not-for-profit providers.
Business models The study examines the variety of business models under which the leading developers operate (section 4.2.1). While all have something to offer, they are not yet optimal. Key elements of a suggested optimal model include: Sufficient government capital and development sites to achieve a sizeable annual development program for a reasonable number of individual providers; A framework for offering planning incentives to affordable housing developers in a variety of market contexts; Rent setting policies that enable providers to be viable, including having the capacity to meet the costs of a modest level of financial gearing and to generate surpluses for reinvestment in additional supply; and Policies that allow for a mix of low and moderate income clients to address a range of needs for affordable housing and to support social mix and economic participation objectives of governments. To optimise access for very low income households in some high cost markets, additional operating or tenant subsidies could be incorporated in the model.
Corporate governance and capacity The 2004 report noted that governments had been actively involved in the foundation and governance of most of the leading developers at that time. As regulatory systems have developed and governments have gained confidence in the performance of established community housing organisations, this governance model has not been replicated and several previous agencies close to government have been restructured to give them more independence. The typical lead or emergent developer organisation is either a company limited by guarantee or a company limited by shares with a skills based (rather than representative) Board. There has been significant up-scaling of corporate governance and professional capacity among the leading developers achieved through their own efforts, combined with those of network agencies, private consultants and governments. However, there is no comprehensive, coordinated and tailored approach to supporting capacity building across the industry and to steering a longer term growth path. There is clear evidence that successful providers have been attracting highly qualified people with a variety of skills to Boards and as CEOs, with increased emphasis being given to appointing directors with business, property, financial and legal skills. This finding is important because of the growing complexity of the business of these agencies. It also indicates the attractiveness of the not-for-profit housing industry to social entrepreneurs with both social and business expertise. There is a dynamic organisational environment surrounding the expansion of the not-for-profit sector at present, involving, for example, the formation of group structures, new entrants (particularly multi-function agencies), functional re-alignments within and between organisations, organisational mergers and new alliances. There was a general view among stakeholders that restructuring was likely to continue at a pace for some time, as providers seek to improve their economies of scale, harness capacity (such as development expertise) and accelerate growth. Specialised research will be necessary to understand the impact that these changes have on the capacity, performance and accountability of the sector over time.
International systems Greater depth and variety of experience of providing affordable housing through not-for-profit organisations can be found outside of Australia. Examining overseas cases has enabled the study to pinpoint those elements of effective policy and innovative practice in larger and better established not-for-profit housing sectors that may have applications here. Three sets of lessons are identified: Lessons about adequate finance for supply, especially: the role of government strategies (such as guarantees and wholesale fund raising by a specialist intermediary) in reducing the cost of private finance; the benefits of long term government funding commitments; the importance of cost-effective government funding strategies and the advantages to be gained by directing a flow of funds to larger scale, well performing and publicly accountable not-for-profit providers. Lessons for land supply and planning, especially: dedicating public land for affordable housing; using planning policies, such as inclusionary zoning, to obtain appropriate sites; encouraging innovation through competitions for the right to develop these sites for affordable housing (evaluated against criteria promoting quality, energy efficient designs, sustainable construction methods etc.); and promoting collaborative local models, such as public/private /not-for-profit partnerships. Lessons for appropriate regulation of affordable housing provision, especially: the need for a clear legislative framework specifying public policy goals and measurable social tasks for affordable housing developers; an appropriate business model to achieve cost capped limited profit development; making industry information publicly available and having built in evaluation; and elevating accountability to tenants.
The way forward In normative terms, the report argues that governments aiming to develop an affordable housing industry centred on not-for-profit suppliers should seek to establish the following key elements: A financing model that offers a cost-effective mix of public financial incentives and private financing, and associated funds management institutions; Planning policies and mechanisms capable of ensuring the timely and cost-effective provision of appropriately located affordable housing, including opportunities for designated affordable housing providers to access well located and serviced government or commercially owned land; A variety of providers capable of procuring and managing housing; Public policy settings that cover: o Requirements for affordable rents linked to subsidy assistance for those who cannot pay rent that is sufficient to attain viability for providers; o Well defined needs based eligibility policies and allocations criteria; o A core set of housing and service standards; and o Business rules relating to the realm of activities of providers, their generation and use of surpluses (or profits) and the control and preservation of assets, generated through the funding and subsidy arrangements; A robust regulatory system that is capable of giving assurance to governments, investors and customers that policy outcomes and financial and service requirements are being met, and that provider business risks are identified and managed. The regulatory regime must also include the power to redress cases of failing performance; and Supporting infrastructure and capacity building measures designed to secure and maintain the capability of individual providers and the industry as a whole. Evidence about local and international practice that is related to each of the above core elements of an affordable housing model (which was collected for this research or drawn from previous studies that are cited throughout the report) provides the basis for suggesting a strategic forward path to governments in Australia, as summarised below.
Funding and fund raising A more certain long term government funding stream at reasonable scale is required to assist capable not-for-profit housing developers to plan ahead and develop their businesses, so that they can make a sizeable contribution to addressing the shortage of affordable housing across Australia. The Australian Governments National Rental Affordability Scheme (NRAS) (being implemented from 2007/08, initially over four years) shows significant potential to deliver volume funding-potentially to promote supply of 100,000 additional rental dwellings over eight years. However, the scheme requires enhancements if it is to support not-for-profit developers more effectively. These could include setting aside and channelling incentives to this class of developers (for competitive allocation among providers within that group) and linking NRAS incentive payments directly with other public funding and policy levers, especially access to developable land, as discussed below. The Australian Government could also facilitate wholesale private fund raising for not-for-profit affordable housing developers (using NRAS incentives and/or other mechanisms, such as bond financing and government guarantees).This will bring cost and volume advantages compared with current approaches, which mostly involve individual providers raising retail finance project by project. A specialised fund raising intermediary could be established for this purpose. However, NRAS alone will not be sufficient to achieve a robust funding model to develop a larger permanent supply of affordable housing in Australia. Analysis of funding options and international funding models suggest that there would be value in governments rethinking the total package of funding incentives and strategies required to foster a viable and sustainable not-for-profit affordable housing development industry across Australia. How a future package is designed will determine the scale, rate and key attributes of affordable housing that can be generated and to what extent the housing procured can be preserved as affordable housing. To determine the optimum funding mix, the contribution of each of the following potential components should be assessed: long term government capital and/or recurrent funding commitments; tax incentives and government guarantees; and public lending. A mechanism for collecting and distributing funds from a variety of sources could also be considered. Clear public policy goals and targets for addressing housing needs and securing affordability outcomes must inform whatever overall funding approach is adopted, as discussed below.
Concepts and terms Affordable housing is a widely used term that takes both generic and more specific meanings. In this report the term is used to refer to housing that is procured directly by not-for-profit providers using a mix of public and private finance for renting at rates that are below market levels to low and moderate income households in housing need. The potential to facilitate pathways to home ownership for tenants is also recognised as an affordable housing activity of providers, although this is not occurring to any extent in Australia yet. The term social housing is used in this study to refer to an existing portfolio of housing (around 5 per cent of the Australian housing system) that has been financed mainly with public funds, is owned largely by state and territory governments and is managed mostly by state housing authorities (85 per cent), with the remainder managed by a plethora of mostly small community based providers. Lack of growth in social housing over the last decade and loss of other forms of low cost housing have contributed to growing numbers of low income households in housing stress. Not-for-profit housing providers are defined as being independently incorporated, not-for-profit but commercially savvy organisations that invest in, develop and own housing for a core social purpose (broadly, to provide appropriate secure and affordable rental housing and to support their tenants) and to reinvest any proceeds of their activities in expanding their core business.
Findings Policy frameworks The 2004 report on affordable housing argued that three factors would be critical to deliver a large volume of affordable housing through the not-for-profit sector in the short to medium term: a secure and ongoing government capital investment program; a mechanism to raise and channel large volumes of private finance; and capacity building in the delivery system (Milligan et al. 2004). A subsequent report emphasised the need to bring in positive planning policies for affordable housing and to utilise government land to contribute to the supply task (Milligan 2005). Since 2004, stronger policy foundations to support a larger and more diversified affordable housing sector have been established. Most jurisdictions in Australia have moved to enhance and better integrate housing, planning and regulatory policies applying to not-for-profit providers to support their expansion, and there has been a small increase in new supply of dedicated affordable housing. However, by the beginning of 2008 there was little evidence that not-for-profit providers could achieve continuing growth in affordable housing supply at scale, principally because of an insufficient commitment to ongoing public investment at the level that would be required to generate volume and to leverage private sector interest. Following the re-entry of the Australian Government into a leading role in housing policy during 2008, through the policies and mechanisms described in section 3.9, the not-for-profit sector now has the potential to operate at a scale not seen before in this country. Nevertheless, strategic elements of a policy model that would be capable of supporting sustainable growth in that sector need further development, as discussed under the way forward below. Providers In 2004, the number of active organisations and their property portfolios were extremely small. The seven largest providers had developed around 1,200 units of affordable housing over the preceding decade. Nevertheless, assessment of the contributions of those agencies, combined with international evidence of what can be achieved by using large, dedicated affordable housing developers, indicated that there was considerable potential for growth and innovation in Australia (Milligan et al. 2004). Over the five years since the previous study, the affordable housing businesses of not-for-profit providers in Australia have developed in scale, complexity and maturity. There are now more and larger organisations undertaking housing development using a range of financing, procurement and design approaches. The study differentiates not-for-profit housing providers with good potential for growth using a five level classification: 1. Established developers already procuring at modest scale; 2. Emergent developers intending to scale up, some with limited procurement experience; 3. Aspiring developers with some limited procurement experience, unclear growth path; 4. Growth partners-growing through management services linked to supply; and 5. Traditional asset-rich service agencies expanding into affordable housing. Preliminary estimates of numbers of organisations in each group in 2009 have been made in this study but these need to be confirmed by a more comprehensive survey (table 8). Overall, our field research indicates that around 40 not-for-profit organisations are to some extent involved in housing procurement activities. The study also tracks what has happened to the business models, governance and performance of agencies identified in 2004 as being the leading developers and examines others that have entered the field. Growth levels and patterns At the end of 2007/08, the eleven established providers owned over 5,440 dwellings and had plans to finalise procurement of at least another 2,330 in the near future. When the current development pipeline has been exhausted, there will have been about a 220 per cent growth in stock under the control of the leading eleven players since 2004. This group of developers had net asset worth of just under $1.3 billion in 2007/08. Scale is starting to emerge in the sector. While a few lead developers have less than 500 dwellings, the largest has nearly 1800 dwellings under its control and all the agencies in this group have reasonable development pipelines. Growth has happened through both procurement and transfers onto provider balance sheets. A recent history of mergers and amalgamations has also assisted this movement to larger scale, assisting providers to realise the economies of scale that are available for both procurement and property management. The most significant change since 2004 has been the emergence, under the influence of deliberate government policy, of a class of developers (called housing associations) in Victoria. As a consequence, the Victorian housing association sector, comprising seven of the eleven leading developers, has started to resemble well established not-for-profit housing sectors that operate in similar countries overseas. Other jurisdictions have not emulated Victoria to the same extent, although there are increasing signs that they will, with NSW, WA, the ACT and, most recently, SA making policy commitments similar to those that have propagated significant change in Victoria (although with less funding on offer). Projects The leading not-for-profit developers in Australia are starting to gain experience in delivering appropriate housing products that are cost-effective, and have the approval of their tenants and the wider industry. Several providers have been prominent in industry awards. Purpose designed products, such as boarding houses and studio and one bedroom apartments, that are durable for long term renting (and are not supplied in the for-profit market), are emerging. A large share of developments is aimed at population groups with particular design needs. Waste, water and energy efficient housing designs that reduce living costs for tenants and meet broader environmental sustainability goals are also emerging features of projects in the sector. Larger, more experienced providers are starting to undertake larger scale developments and venturing into mixed tenure, mixed use development projects, with good results so far. To extend the benefits of having purpose designed and built housing, the study suggests that development rather than market based procurement should be encouraged strongly in future policy directions, unless it can be demonstrated that the latter approach will provide similar benefits at a comparable cost.
Access to land Options to assist affordable housing developers to overcome the significant barriers to accessing land that they are experiencing could include a mix of: lower priced government land; deferred purchase of government sites; long term leasing of public land; transfer of existing public housing redevelopment sites to not-for-profit developers; and capture of some of the benefits of major uplifts in land value in strategic areas (such as transit corridors), specifically to enable the inclusion of affordable housing in those locations. Importantly, land supply mechanisms designed to support the sector should be designated in legislation and policy, not negotiated on a project-by-project or precinct-by-precinct basis (as has tended to occur to date) to increase certainty and to reduce transaction costs for organisations. Public governance Public governance of this sector should be national in approach to promote scale, to give more opportunities to entrepreneurial providers, to attract private investors and to reduce compliance costs. All spheres of government should have clearly defined roles under the national framework. The need for joined up government action across treasuries (as funders and fund raisers) and state housing, land development and planning agencies, together with greater engagement of local government, have been highlighted as key areas for greater collaboration. Beyond governments, coordinating networks that promote regular and ongoing dialogue between policy-makers, funders, providers and regulators of affordable housing will be critical. Establishing a high level, multi-stakeholder Affordable Housing Industry Council with responsibility for policy and financial advice, to guide industry development and review and partnership building, would be one means by which such collaboration could be fostered and steered.
Policy setting and regulation There is evidence of a lack of historical clarity and consistency concerning the vision for, and social goals of, an expanded affordable housing industry centred on not-for-profit providers across Australia. An enhanced national framework should start with a determination of the vision and key social goals for an affordable housing industry. Desirably, such direction setting would take into account both the significant level of demonstrated unmet need for social housing and the affordability problems of those in the gap between where social housing is targetted and the private market-in other words, the aim should be to assist a range and mix of lower income households with a variety of products. After social goals are determined, core requirements applying to providers will need to be defined and set down in a regulatory code (and possibly legislation). These should cover: core standards (principally about housing design and location, construction, maintenance and service delivery); rent setting and affordability benchmarks; eligibility and allocation policies; rights to occupancy; any corporate governance requirements that are beyond the corporate regulators jurisdiction (such as tenant accountability); provider business limitations (e.g. on scope of activities) and financial risk management (e.g. liquidity requirements); and ownership and preservation rules for housing assets. Once these purposes, rules and standards are settled and financing packages are put in place, providers can adopt business models that will optimise their ability to contribute to expansion of the sector and regulators can supervise, benchmark and compare their performance.
Capacity building There are roles for governments, peer networks and individual providers in capacity building. One of the first tasks of the proposed national industry council or similar should be to formulate a strategic approach to different kinds of capacity building activities for the industry as a whole, ranging from corporate governance measures through training and skills development to promotion of professional support services. Once a framework is established, implementation could occur through state based plans that can take account of historical legacies, state priorities, and the diversity of operating environments and different housing market opportunities and risks that are facing the industry across Australia. Another important element of capacity building will be a commitment to a range of research and development activities, including enhancing information about the industry such as by utilising regulators data bases and periodic surveys of providers and residents, a dedicated research program and a systemic approach to evaluation that covers policies, providers and projects.},

abstract={Purpose: The authors propose a theoretical basis for understanding the role of ecosystem intermediaries in the configuration of social entrepreneurship identities in social purpose organisations (SPOs) and their business model innovations (BMIs). Design/methodology/approach: Adopting a retrospective multiple-case study, the authors offer insights into the paths/elements that determine the building of 44 social entrepreneurship identities in the context of an emerging economy (Mexico). Findings: The study sheds light on the role of intermediaries in the configuration of the entrepreneurial identities of Mexican SPOs and BMIs, as well as several externalities generated during the process of capturing the social and economic value, especially when social innovations are focussed on solving societal, economic and ecological social problems. Research limitations/implications: The first limitation is related to the analysis of intermediaries within the social entrepreneurship ecosystem, which needs more conceptual and empirical evidence. The second limitation is that the analysis focussed only on intervened SPOs, as the authors did not control for non-intervened SPOs. Thus, this allows for future in-depth analysis of intermediary efficiency in a focus group (intervened SPOs) and a control group (non-intervened SPOs). Practical implications: The study also provides insights for Mexican SPOs on how a social entrepreneurship identity helps to capture the value creation of social innovations within an innovation ecosystem. Indeed, it is strongly aligned with the United Nations' Social Development Goals. Originality/value: The study enhances the discussion about how intermediaries could encourage social entrepreneurial identity, as well as how intermediary intervention could facilitate the design and implementation of BMIs in the innovation ecosystem. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Similarly, entrepreneurial orientation is a concept that has been widely applied to business firms but has not been empirically tested in social enterprises. Moreover, the literature does not present a widely accepted and tested conceptual model relating entrepreneurial orientation, market orientation and performance, in the realm of social enterprises. In order to fill this gap, this research assesses how these strategic orientations affect social and economic performance in the setting of social enterprises. Structural equation modeling was used as a means to analyze the hypothesized relationships. After testing the model on a sample of 805 Portuguese social enterprises, the findings show that both social entrepreneurship and market orientations significantly impact social performance. The results also indicate that market orientation mediates the effect of social entrepreneurship orientation on the performance of social enterprises. © 2020, International Society for Third-Sector Research.},

It compares energy communities in two countries, France and the Netherlands, where energy community ecosystems have attained uneven levels of maturity. We argue that an energy community ecosystem can fully realize its potential if: 1) it revolves around keystone actors that can foster diversity; 2) it is structured around local capacity builders that can act as catalysers; and 3) it develops both competing and symbiotic relations with incumbent energy actors. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

The geography of impact investing, however, is largely unexamined, and it is not clear why some regional impact-investing communities are more vibrant than other communities. Regional differences in entrepreneurial activities are increasingly explained by differences in the vitality of entrepreneurial ecosystems, the set of interconnected forces that promote and sustain regional entrepreneurship. The purpose of this paper is to leverage insights from entrepreneurial ecosystems studies to understand the dynamics of communities that encourage and support impact investing. Design/methodology/approach: To explain inter-regional differences in the prevalence and intensity of impact investing, this conceptual paper draws from research on entrepreneurial ecosystems and impact investment to theorize about the ecosystem attributes and components that drive vibrant impact investing communities. Findings: It is theorized that vibrant impact investing ecosystems have three system-level attributes – diversity, cohesion and coordination – that are influenced by the core components of the ecosystems, including the characteristics of investors, the presence of social impact support organizations and cultural values that promote blending logics. Originality/value: The theoretical model contributes to research on impact investing and hybrid organizing, produces concrete implications for ecosystem builders and sets an agenda for future research. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={In the business ethics literature, the growing interest in social entrepreneurship has remained limited to the assumption that pursuing a social mission will clash against the pursuit of associated economic achievements. This ignores recent developments in the social entrepreneurship literature which show that social missions and economic achievement can also have a mutually constitutive relation. We address this gap adopting the notion of shared value (SV) for an ethical inquiry of social entrepreneurship. Using a sensemaking framework, we assume that the emergence of SV propositions can be captured through the analysis of how social entrepreneurs make sense of events of change, selecting the journey of three exemplar cases for an inductive empirical inquiry. From our findings, we propose three themes for further examination. First, the ethical groundings of entrepreneurial SV are mostly shaped by idiosyncratic imperatives that inform both social mission and economic gain from the onset. Second, the ethical groundings of entrepreneurial SV will be likely operationalised as a filtering device, which allows for resilience as well as potentially detrimental blind spots. And third, the ethical groundings of entrepreneurial SV are expressed through ongoing transparency. Whilst there are agendas, these are not necessarily hidden but instead are likely put on show for the scrutiny of markets and communities. We hope that this evidence can add more light to our still modest understanding of the ethical groundings of social entrepreneurship. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to identify tensions that are emerging in the invention and implementation of social innovation by social entrepreneurial teams and highlights elements that influence the type of tension encountered. Design/methodology/approach: Four cases are selected theoretically, studied individually, and compared to one another to identify tensions and patterns of tensions. Findings: The findings reveal the predominant tensions related to goals and identity during social innovation invention and those related to time and knowledge during social innovation implementation. The size of the entrepreneurial team, the nature of the social innovation, and the interest orientation – that is, the overlap between entrepreneurial team members and beneficiaries – are found to play a role in the type of tensions encountered and their content. Research limitations/implications: The chosen research approach limits the generalizability of the research results. Replication in other settings and with other types of social innovation is therefore encouraged. Originality/value: In contrast to most existing studies, this research focuses on nascent social innovation projects borne by teams. It proposes that social-business tensions are not necessarily predominant in social innovation management. It suggests the importance of interest orientation as an underestimated factor in the study of social entrepreneurship. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: States and development bodies are increasingly stimulating social enterprise activity in communities as an empowering social and economic development intervention. This type of development initiative is often facilitated by actors who are external to communities, and the role of community members is not clear. This paper aims to explore whether facilitated social enterprise benefits or disempowers communities. Design/methodology/approach: The focus is a case study of a project based in Scotland designed to stimulate the creation of social enterprises involved in community growing. The case study approach involved a mix of methods, including formal (semi-structured) interviews, participant observation and analysis of documentary evidence. Analysis of findings was undertaken using Muñoz and Steinerowski’s (2012) theory of social entrepreneurial behaviour. Findings: Findings suggest that social enterprise that originates outside communities and is facilitated by external actors is potentially disempowering, particularly when social enterprise development does not necessarily align with community needs. The paper reiterates findings in previous studies that certain roles in facilitated social enterprise require to be community-led. Projects that do attempt to facilitate social enterprise would benefit from community participation at the project planning stage. Originality/value: If facilitated social enterprise is increasingly promoted as an empowering development intervention, this paper provides insight about how facilitated social enterprise occurs in practice and gives preliminary information about possible barriers to empowerment using this approach to development. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: This paper aims to understand how social value is created in a context characterized by institutional complexity. By identifying stakeholders interacting in a social enterprise and the logics guiding their expected and experienced value, the study describes how social value is created when different institutional logics embedded in strong-tie networks are bridged. Design/methodology/approach: Concepts of structural holes and institutional logics were applied to the empirical case of a social enterprise. Interviews provided the primary empirical material, but multiple data collection methods were used. Findings: A shared goal facilitated co-existence of competing value logics, and provided common space forming multiple social value outcomes as products of the different logics. Research limitations/implications: Limited to one case, this study shows that the interaction of otherwise unconnected stakeholders in a social enterprise, and their embeddedness in different institutional logics, provides one explanation for why and how social value is created. Practical implications: Acknowledging and addressing gaps in knowledge and resources can lead to social value creation if social enterprises remain open to different logics. This suggests that co-existence of different logics can be a key factor for successful social value creation in social enterprises, if the competing logics are turned into complementary sources. Originality/value: Dependency on logics from different networks of stakeholders shapes social enterprises to produce outcomes consistent with the different logics. The multiplicity of social value outcomes poses challenges for evaluating the success of social enterprises, especially when the tendency is to use evaluation approaches from the for-profit sector, focusing on the economic logic. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: Are entrepreneurial opportunities discovered or created? The debate around this question has crucial implications for successful organizational change management in the business world. The present conceptual paper transcends this debate by embedding the concept of the entrepreneurial opportunities within a Luhmannian systems – theoretical framework which accentuates the unique role of organization and change in the age of functional differentiation. The purpose of this paper is to show how the strategic navigation of the borders between function systems such as politics, science, education, religion, art, or, of course, economy leads to the discovery or creation new opportunities for both business and social entrepreneurship. Design/methodology/approach: The paper combines Niklas Luhmann’s theory of social differentiation with Kim and Mauborgne’s Blue Ocean Strategy. The key argument is that the alternative regimes of social differentiation, such as segmentation, centralization, stratification, and functional differentiation, create distinct pools of entrepreneurial opportunities to be discovered, created, and exploited by adequate business models. (Business) Organizations, therefore, need to strategically adjust the amount of attention they devote to the different forms of social differentiation. The argument is buttressed with illustrative examples of business models related to the regime of functional differentiation. Findings: A paradoxical finding is that the multifunctional business models which explicitly draw on the value creation potential of the most recent form of social differentiation, functional differentiation, remain little known even though they infuse business organizations with a unique capacity of new venture discovery and creation in the modern society. Originality/value: Multifunctional business models have so far remained unexplored in entrepreneurship theory and practice. This paper develops a first strategic approach to the discovery or creation of both multifunctional business models and a broader framework of multifunctional organization models. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={This article pursues an innovative dimension of social entrepreneurship in the agricultural sector that keeps rural areas viable, so-called social farming. Social entrepreneurship appears as an essential driver in the European economy and it heads toward new opportunities mainly through its impact on social integration, economic sustainability, and fair society. Social farming and social farms can successfully respond to the challenge of social exclusion and lack of social services provision and other opportunities in rural areas through alternative therapeutic activities, sheltered working places or integrative educational activities in a farm environment. From this perspective, a social farm should correspond to the definition of a social enterprise. By introducing the basic frames of social entrepreneurship and social farming in general and in the Czech Republic, and by concentrating on fifteen Czech social farms, this paper presents an insight into this retro-innovative practice of social integration systems in the countryside. It mainly answers the question, whether social farming complies fully with social entrepreneurship stream, and it explores the role of the social farm in rural development by using semi-structured and in-depth interviews. © 2018 Eliška Hudcová et al., published by Sciendo.},

abstract={In order to contribute to the debate about social entrepreneurship, we take an empirical perspective and describe the phenomenon in Catalonia, Spain, during the financial crises of the early twenty-first century. For this aim, we conducted 43 in-depth interviews with social entrepreneurs, launched a web-based survey with 90 responses, and built a database with 347 organizations and/or ventures settled in Catalonia with an explicit social/environmental goal. The data show that many social/environmental initiatives emerged during the economic crisis, either as a self-employment alternative to unemployment, or as a commercial venture started by nonprofit organizations as a reaction to the reduction in public expense in this sector. In addition, the crisis fueled the emergence of ventures oriented to non-market exchange and social currencies. As a whole, we argue that this new reality can be conceptualized as the emergence of an unsettled Strategic Action Field where banks, business schools and public administrations alike promote the label of “social entrepreneurship” through awards and startup services, whereas other groups claiming the same social/environmental goals contest this market-oriented definition of the field. © 2018, International Society for Third-Sector Research and The Johns Hopkins University.},

abstract={This article views social entrepreneurship as a relatively new model for achieving sustainable development. It also identifies development narratives that social entrepreneurs (SEs) construct to represent and promote their work as an important research gap in development studies. Drawing on the development and narratology literature, and employing computational linguistics (CL) techniques, this article compares the development narratives of 1076 Ashoka SEs across two periods (2009–2013 and 1994–1998) and two economies (developing and developed). CL analyses reveal important themes that characterize the identity, framing and orientations of development SEs across time and economies. The findings demonstrate how SE development narratives i) tend to be more pragmatic and solution-centric, and contain less political ideology than conventional development narratives, ii) combine extant development ideas and models but reframe them in new ways to address contemporary, complex development challenges, and iii) reflect a ‘bottom-up’ approach that encourages local ownership and collaborations with various social and economic sectors to achieve development goals. Overall, this study identifies the increasing importance of SEs in the development industry and reveals new aspects of SEs—their latent political framing, collective-utilitarian identities, and topical areas—that require further research via development narratives. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

The purpose of this paper is to provide empirical evidence assessing this value. Design/methodology/approach: The assessment and insights were derived through a concurrent mixed method data collection strategy with 241 responses from members of SEs in the UK. Findings: In terms of frequency, the use of SENs is still sporadic, denoting an immature stage of network lifecycle development. Moreover, it was identified that usage was affected primarily by the perceived usefulness of the information available. The ultimate value created was primarily of an informative nature rather than knowledge exchange. Practical implications: A framework is developed describing the structure, content and interaction dimensions of value of SENs. The understanding of this value offers opportunities to shape government interventions and current practices of SENs in assisting SEs and providing an active, knowledge sharing community.

In other words, to what extent do personal and contextual variables affect the motivations, intentions and behaviours of social entrepreneurs? The model is based on a quantitative study conducted by 186 Saudi business owners during 2016.

abstract={Social entrepreneurship (SE) has evolved from an initial period of explosive growth (SE 1.0), during which research focused on organizational and founder characteristics, to a stage that witnessed the rise of institutions facilitating SE formation and growth (SE 2.0). At present, while expansion in the number and scope of social enterprises continues, there is also a concerted effort underway to ascertain whether social enterprises are performing as expected (SE 3.0). A framework to assess the performance of SE, building on the type of metrics employed by business firms, is presented in this article. The framework—consisting of action-resources, predictors, outputs, outcomes, and impact—is intended to measure achievement along a timeline. Examples of how the framework would be used are provided for social enterprises with a range of social purposes, including one that involves an existing enterprise with the mission of reducing recidivism among incarcerated women. Brief comparisons with measures actually used help identify how the time-based approach laid out here would enhance assessment efforts and even serve as a basis for planning and decision making. The proposed framework could serve as a template to assess all social enterprises regardless of purpose, stakeholder mix, or scale of operations. © 2017 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University},

abstract={Purpose: The paper provides an extensive, comprehensive and up-to-date qualitative scoping literature review of financial inclusion and other related concepts, and focuses in particular on the Colombian context, and the accessibility as well as barriers to banking services. It structures the themes and dimensions of scholarly debates on financial inclusion in the literature highlighting avenues for future research to fill various gaps. Design/methodology: This scoping literature review rigorously identifies the most relevant research and variables pertaining to financial inclusion and social innovation. Findings: Based on a scoping literature review, a comprehensive framework of key concepts of financial inclusion, scholarly contributions, countries and variables is presented. Research limitations/implications: Owing to the methodological approach of this paper and its rather theoretical nature, this research seeks to enrich scientific debates pertaining to the empirical data displayed, especially on the case of Colombia. Practical implications: The most central variables that are linked to the theme of financial inclusion are explored, and hence this paper forms a basis for future qualitative and quantitative studies. Social implications: This research article contributes to public policy making on financial inclusion aimed at reducing levels of socio-economic inequality. Originality/value: In business and management research a degree of conceptual confusion prevails on the theme of financial inclusion. This paper attempts to clarify different types of variables and one country specific case to provide more solid analytical tools for scholars and analysts.},

Our analysis distinguishes network bricolage from organizational-level bricolage and develops a theory to explain it. A greater understanding of network bricolage has important implications for the theory and practice of entrepreneurship in Africa, including the need to understand the deeper ontological and epistemological assumptions that underpin informal and formal institutions. © 2016, © 2016 Africa Academy of Management.},

abstract={In the past few years social responsibility has appeared as a significant element of sustainable economic and social development. Although, when it comes to social responsibility, it is the large corporations that most often come under public scrutiny, social responsibility should be the backbone of actions of all the other actors of society. This paper puts special emphasis on the importance and significance of social responsibility of university, which directly influences the quality of life in the community with its educational, research and social actions. By behaving in a socially responsible manner universities show that they know how to respond to current social issues, both through projects related to community development, as well as through educational programmes that educate young people to become socially responsible individuals and equal participants in creating positive social change. As the society we live in is faced with complex economic and social issues, there is a need for a new business paradigm which is based on principles of social entrepreneurship (generating social benefits and solving social problems in a more responsible, innovative and enterprising way). Universities that recognize the importance of social entrepreneurship enrich their educational programmes and actively participate in creation of entrepreneurial environment that stimulates cross-sectoral cooperation and joint solving of social problems. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={This paper explores how bureaucracy impedes the implementation of higher education (HE) policy at Japanese universities. Administrative systems employ Weberian legal-rational bureaucratic practices that are central to the institutional identity of a university. Rather than the means to internationalisation and reform in general, these systems themselves become the end, usually in direct opposition to not only innovation and change but, indeed, the university mission itself. After first outlining the macro-level processes and policies of the internationalisation of Japanese HE, I take an ethnographic approach to illustrate the micro-level administrative practices and assumptions at the university, framing them within the social theory of bureaucracy to allow for comparison with HE in other parts of East Asia and worldwide. As a way forward, I propose we borrow theories on social entrepreneurship to potentially resolve the challenge of embedded administrative practices and static institutional identities, a bureaucratic ‘utopia of rules’ [Graeber, D. 2015.

However, previous studies on social entrepreneurship, mostly perceived it from the Western perspective, which was not established from a religious point of view which is a consequence of the lack of religious relations. In fact, the perspective of religion is rarely found in the literature on social entrepreneurship in previous studies. The term of Islamic social entrepreneurship is still new in social entrepreneurship and social enterprise theory and research. Entrepreneurship from an Islamic perspective closely considers on principles of thoughts that are affirmed in the following two ways. Firstly, Islam encourages entrepreneurial development and entrepreneurship as an integral part of its religion. Secondly, in the perspective of ownership resources and treasure, Muslims are khalifah and agents of trust of Allah who are responsible to generate prosperity and considering that doing business is a part of ibadah or good deed. Third, in the perspective of being successful in doing business, the most important thing is to be as useful as possible for the society (cooperation for existence) and to live ethically in correspondence with the philosophy of belief in Allah the Almighty. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.},

Innovation in using marketbased solutions and social or impact investing tools to tackle societies’ ills has boomed. Yet philanthrocapitalism remains controversial. The continuing rise in inequality fuels criticism that philanthrocapitalism is a product of an unjust economic system, or a public relations attempt to put lipstick on a (capitalist) pig. We discuss the current state of philanthrocapitalism and what the next phase needs to address.

Despite considerable hybridisation, the state's continued role in defining the operating environment, resource inputs and material position of HAs is demonstrated. Recent policies of deficit reduction and welfare conditionality have challenged independent purposes of HAs. Panel organisations displayed a range of responses to these recent policies, reflecting different organisational values. Three positioning narratives are identified: 'independent social entrepreneurs', 'contractors of the state' and 'protectors of public value'. The relationship to the state remains critical to understanding each of these positions and their implications for the future hybridisation of HAs. © Policy Press 2015.},

abstract={In the context of rising rates of metabolic disorders and global attention to the“obesity epidemic” in Oceania, public health in Samoa tends to focus on multisectoral efforts to increase vegetable consumption and production. To understand better what non-health officials thought about food environments and health, we sought out a group of food actors (food trade and agricultural entrepreneurs, distributors, producers and food policy practitioners) who were actively creating a “healthier” food environment in Samoa. They posited that the market was both the problem with, and the solution to, the “obesity epidemic.” These food actors positioned themselves as social entrepreneurs or, more aptly, as altruistic capitalists, who aimed to transform the food environment by fixing the market, a practice they felt would in turn produce healthier and more prosperous Samoans. We argue that while alternative food movements in the global north tend to link local production with local consumption, Samoan food actors have focused on local production as a way to provide Samoans with financial prosperity, which in turn would provide opportunities for healthier consumption.

abstract={The financial viability of biodiesel production from Jatropha is estimated under real-life African conditions. The assessment is modelled from the data of an oil producer with a social entrepreneurial business model in Tanzania. A first-round cost analysis shows that the total cost of biodiesel production including all company costs and taxes is significantly higher than Tanzanian and typical East-African market prices for diesel; however, when by-products are utilised as additional sources of revenue, biodiesel production is projected to become financially viable. While these findings are far removed from the recently hyped expectations surrounding Jatropha as an energy crop, they also do not lend support to the current widespread discrediting of Jatropha bio-energy. We conclude that Jatropha biodiesel production in SubSaharan Africa can be financially viable and socially benign, but only under certain conditions.

abstract={Nanotechnology has driven speculations and projections of all colors and shapes. However, there is a paucity of future scenarios that explore distinct nanotechnology innovation and governance models. This study asks: What could the dominant innovation models look like in the future, and, in contrast, what could alternative ones look like? And how conducive are those different models to mitigating sustainability challenges and improving quality of life? To make the exploration tangible, this study focuses on nanotechnology innovation in an urban region (Phoenix, Arizona). The study uses a mixed methods approach, linking intuitive and analytical scenario construction, to allow for creativity while ensuring analytical rigor. Findings suggest four different models of nanotechnology innovation and governance affect sustainability challenges quite differently. Market-oriented and closed collaboration amplify the lack of social cohesion, result in low-wage service sector jobs, and intensify resource extraction rates. Alternatively, social entrepreneurship and open-source innovation are more conducive to addressing sustainability challenges and improving quality of life, in particular in urban areas. The study concludes that the way a society innovates and governs its emerging technologies is decisive for the way those technologies work in favor of, or against comprehensive public interests. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Social enterprise is increasingly viewed by governments worldwide as a promising means of promoting development. In South Africa, too, this sector is identified as a strategic growth area. Although there is no final consensus on the definition of social enterprise, certain characteristics are generally agreed. These include the idea that social enterprise prioritises social needs over profit maximisation, and involves marginalised people within viable businesses that have socially beneficial outcomes. Academic research on social enterprise has largely come from business studies, focusing on the internal functioning of social enterprise organisations, the figure of the social entrepreneur, the relationship between the social enterprise sector and the state, and on what the sector needs to flourish commercially. Social issues, especially analyses of power within the sector, have been relatively neglected. This paper addresses that gap, drawing on a wider development studies literature on the social economy to inform an examination of power relationships in the craft industry in South Africa, where narratives of social enterprise are pervasive. I argue that although empowerment is an explicit aim of many craft organisations, the most prominent discourses within the industry often rely on and perpetuate objectifying constructions of producers. These manifest particularly through notions of 'saving', shaping a moral economy that entrenches difference along lines of black-white, north-south, and healthy-diseased. Such discourses run counter to the aims of empowerment that are central to the ethos of social enterprise, and should challenge both policymakers and academics to think carefully about how power works within the sector. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Human deprivation and suffering around the world are increasing despite the efforts of traditional aid-based approaches focused on alleviating poverty and improving the quality of life for marginalized communities. There is ample evidence that billions of dollars in aid money have been expended on development projects that are fundamentally unsustainable. On the other hand, social enterprises, which improve lives and livelihoods through practical market-based approaches, are growing in number. Systems Thinking can be especially helpful in navigating the complexity and chaos inherent in social ventures in developing communities. Lack of clarity in the roles, responsibilities, and returns for the various stakeholders epitomizes this chaos and is a major contributor to the failure of such projects. By employing Systems Thinking, entrepreneurs can establish accountability mechanisms, ensure equity for all stakeholders, and facilitate system sustainability. Though much research exists on both Systems Thinking and social enterprise, few sources discuss how Systems Thinking can be practically applied to conceptualize, build, and sustain social enterprises in an easy-to-understand manner. This paper synthesizes definitions of the tenets of Systems Thinking including interdependence, holism, multifinality, equifinality, differentiation, regulation, abstraction, and leverage points. The relevance of each of these tenets to social entrepreneurship is described, and further reinforced, with examples. A practical understanding of these tenets can empower entrepreneurs as they navigate chaotic environments in the quest for social enterprises that create win–win situations for all stakeholders. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

What is different at present is the enthusiasm for alternatives to university-based teacher preparation, as well as the increasing interest in holding teacher preparation programs accountable. I begin by briefly summarizing the criticisms of traditional university-based teacher preparation. I then describe a set of ideas-an ideology-that are central to new efforts to improve teacher education that have altered the landscape (Grossman & Loeb, 2008), including the need to involve social entrepreneurs, the use of data, and holding teacher education accountable in more public ways, including posting value-added scores for program graduates. I conclude with a discussion of unresolved issues that teacher educators all face. Copyright Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Purpose: Social entrepreneurship aims at creating social value for the public good rather than personal wealth or private gain as in the case of commercial entrepreneurship. The purpose of this study was to explore the entrepreneurial activities of self-starter teachers and analyze the factors that facilitate or inhibit the appearance of these activities using the concept of organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) that are neither part of the formal reward system nor a part of an employee's mandatory job description. Design/methodology/approach: Semi-structured interviews with 30 teachers and ten principals from the Israeli elementary and secondary educational system. Findings: It was found that self-starter teachers engage in simple forms of innovative work behaviors (e.g. developing new curricula and teaching methods, initiating and implementing new projects, including school events). Additionally, the teacher's decision to go the extra-mile and initiate new projects or devise new curricula is related, though, to four major determinants, two of them external (e.g. the principal, the local education authority) and two internal (personal experiences, educational calling and emotional commitment). Originality/value: The paper sheds light on educational entrepreneurship through the concept of OCB. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

In this study, we focus on societal motivation and analyze its link with for-profit ventures’ outcomes, such as likelihood of novelty, external financing, size, and sales. Using samples of Japanese entrepreneurs, we find support for our hypotheses that new ventures established by for-profit entrepreneurs with societal motivation are more novel and that these ventures achieve larger size and sales compared to the ventures of other for-profit entrepreneurs who lack such motivation. However, our findings also indicate that the ventures of for-profit entrepreneurs with societal motivation receive less external financing compared to those with merely economic motivation. © 2014, © 2014 Journal of the Canadian Council for Small Business and Entrepreneurship/Council de la PME et de l'entrepreneuriat.},

abstract={Although it is fitting to celebrate Gideon's promise of representation for indigent criminal defendants at this landmark anniversary, it is important also to note that part of Gideon's legacy should be our recognition of the limits of law in the fulfillment of that promise. Law's most powerful role in the struggle to ensure adequate representation for the poor in criminal cases will be in its capacity to generate and direct the political will to produce institutional change. The critical question to ask is how law can help to move the political actors who control the power of the purse, the organization and administration of indigent defense services, and the shape of the substantive criminal law to allocate the resources and make the institutional changes that are necessary to fix what in many jurisdictions is a failing system of indigent defense. Although there is no silver bullet, there are a variety of complementary strategies that can and should be pursued. These strategies include working for legislative change to limit the scope of the substantive criminal law, promoting the success of structural reform litigation in both federal and state courts, enlisting the support of state bar overseers and associations as well as the ABA, enlisting the private defense bar and NGOs that specialize in criminal defense to set higher norms of practice, urging greater federal government involvement in promoting indigent defense reform in the states, promoting social entrepreneurship to generate creative solutions to the indigent defense crisis, and harnessing both the great power of the media to educate and motivate the public and the more targeted power of the legal academy to educate and motivate the next generation of lawyers to address this pressing problem.},

abstract={The purpose of this paper is to describe a framework developed for assessing Community-based Enterprises' (CBEs') impacts on poverty reduction at the household level in northern Thailand, in the context of the UN Millennium Development Goals. The focus is on the use of principal component analysis to develop a context-specific definition of poverty. The paper explains how business performance measurement, impact assessment of development projects and poverty measurement have been integrated into a single poverty impact assessment framework in relation to CBEs. This framework has two key steps: identification of poverty groups and poverty components; and impact assessment of CBEs and other factors on household poverty. The framework captures a number of qualitative and quantitative aspects of poverty necessary for an accurate relative measure for differing geographical, economic and cultural contexts. The novelty of this paper's approach lies in the design of the framework used to assess poverty impacts of CBEs at the household level. The framework combines three well-known, but traditionally separately used, methodologies in order to better explore the economic dynamic of CBEs on households. The paper is expected to be of high relevance, both theoretically and methodologically, to researchers undertaking similar poverty, micro-enterprise and social entrepreneurship studies in other developing countries. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

Particularly, social entrepreneurship is considered an emerging area of growth which provides the opportunity to make a difference in global community contexts. From this view, this paper proposes a model of entrepreneurship education based on the European Framework on Key Competences for Lifelong Learning to analyze the involvement of universities in related actions as perceived by students within Humanities and Social Sciences. Data was collected from a total sample of 448 students at two Spanish universities. Descriptive analysis was used to examine the development of entrepreneurship-related knowledge, skills and attitudes among students and its implications for labor insertion of future graduates in Humanities and Social contexts.

There is need for conceptualizing network formation processes, and for qualitative studies of the relational aspects of networks and networking, to complement the existing mainly quantitative studies. Within complexity theory, emergence has been linked with formation of entities including networks, and with social entrepreneurship. In this paper, community networks are interpreted as an emergent dynamic process of action and interaction through an empirical case study conducted in an urban community setting. Interviews were conducted with experiential experts at networking. The study was designed within a social capital framework, but frequent reporting of entrepreneurship prompted additional analysis. Practical and theoretical implications of the network study findings are examined in light of the three frameworks together, and further empirical studies are suggested.},

These entrepreneurs use money that they made or inherited to establish organizations from a missionary and visionary posture. This is an arena where women have had significant impact, yet little has been written to celebrate their contributions. The purpose of this paper is to explore the concept of such philanthropy, to suggest where this social ethic might have had its origins, and to provide samples of women who have been entrepreneurial in their social commitment.

abstract={Based on three case studies of Chinese Internet start-ups, this study seeks to address the research question: “How is digital entrepreneurship enacted in China?” Our findings reveal that there was a common theme that underpinned the start-ups we studied, which we termed ‘Qinghuai’ in the language of the informants we spoke with. In this paper, we explain the roots of the concept and its six constituent elements at the individual, organizational, and ecosystem levels. These elements are then abstracted into two dimensions: (a) spiritual idealism and (b) perpetual development. We argue that Qinghuai as a concept is a product and reflection of the cultural and institutional complexity of contemporary China. Further, we discuss how Qinghuai facilitates digital entrepreneurship across the business, organizational, and technological domains. This explanation is substantiated by data from our three cases and juxtaposed with what has been discussed in the existing digital entrepreneurship literature. Finally, as we present the contributions of our study, we elaborate on (a) how Qinghuai reflects the contemporary context of China; (b) how Qinghuai is instrumental to digital entrepreneurship in China; and (c) how Qinghuai is different from other related concepts including Guanxi, collectivism, collective action and social entrepreneurship. We conclude the paper by discussing its limitations, future research opportunities, as well as its practical implications. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={This research investigates how two personality traits common to entrepreneurs permeate their businesses and help successfully position their businesses in consumers’ minds as sustainable. The proposed model suggests that entrepreneurs’ personality traits of resilience and power distance can influence consumers’ perceptions about the business venture’s sustainability practices. Moreover, the study presents evidence these two traits indirectly impact business performance metrics, operationalized as consumers’ patronage intentions and the business’s reputation (i.e., brand equity and ethical leadership). To test the proposed framework, two levels of analysis were used. Level 2 includes data from a sample of 63 entrepreneurs and their self-assessments of their personalities. Level 1 contains data from 383 customers who evaluated the corresponding business ventures. Due to the hierarchical nature and nested structure of the data, hierarchical linear modeling was used to test the hypotheses. Results from this analysis indicate that an entrepreneur’s demonstration of the personality traits of resilience and high-power distance positively influences consumers’ evaluations of the business’ sustainability practices. Findings from this study also indicate that entrepreneurs who show the traits of resilience and high-power distance create positive spillover effects into customers’ perceptions about the ethical nature of the firm’s leadership, their stronger perception of the brand, and their stronger intentions to keep doing business with the firm. Furthermore, all three of these factors were found to be positively related to consumers’ perceptions of the venture’s sustainability practices. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={How cooperatives generate and absorb social capital has attracted a great deal of attention due to the fact that they are collective organizations owned and democratically managed by their members, and, accordingly, are argued to be closely linked to the nature and dynamics of social capital. However, the extant literature and knowledge on the relationship between cooperatives and social capital remain unstructured and fragmented. This paper aims to provide a narrative literature review that integrates both sides of the relationship between cooperatives and social capital. On the one hand, one side involves how cooperatives create internal social capital and spread it in their immediate environment, and, on the other hand, it involves how the presence of social capital promotes the creation and development of cooperatives. In addition, our theoretical framework integrates the dark side of social capital, that is, how the lack of trust, reciprocal relationships, transparency, and other social capital components can lead to failure of the cooperative. On the basis of this review, we define a research agenda that synthesizes key trends and promising research avenues for further advancement of theoretical and empirical insights about the relationship between cooperatives and social capital, placing particular emphasis on rural and agricultural cooperatives. © 2021 by the authors.

It refers to Shapero's Entrepreneurial Event Theory and the adaptation of it for social entrepreneurship in Mair and Noboa (2006) and develops these so that both agency and context may be considered. Design/methodology/approach: Fieldwork comprised a qualitative sample of 12 life-story narratives of social entrepreneurs in Central Scotland. The location was chosen because of its reputation for support of social entrepreneurship, and the qualitative methodology allowed for a depth of inspection and analysis of complex and situational experiences. Findings: Findings include observation of altruism but there are other drivers, including the appeal of the social entrepreneurship business model. Context emerges as a critical feature of social entrepreneurship too, including spurs for altruism and the human, financial and social capitals, skills and experiences of social entrepreneurs. Originality/value: The paper finds that the social entrepreneurship process involves both agency and context and is complex, and for some, reflects a strategic approach similar to commercial entrepreneurship. The paper also proposes further adaptation to Entrepreneurial Event Theory to capture this complexity of the social entrepreneurship process. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The smart cities policy approach has been intensively implemented in European cities under the Horizon 2020 programme. However, these implementations not only reduce the interdependencies among stakeholders to technocratic Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) models, but also fail to question the identities of strategic stakeholders and how they prioritise their business/social models. These aspects are putting democracy at stake in smart cities. Therefore, this article aims to unfold and operationalise multistakeholders’ policy frameworks from the social innovation perspective by suggesting the ex-novo penta-helix framework—including public, private, academia, civic society, and social entrepreneurs/activists—to extend the triple and quadruple-helix frameworks. Based on fieldwork action research conducted from February 2017 to December 2018—triangulating desk research, 75 interviews, and three validation workshops—this article applies the penta-helix framework to map out five strategic dimensions related to (i) multistakeholder helix framework and (ii) the resulting business/social models comparatively in three follower cities of the H2020-Replicate project: Essen (Germany), Lausanne (Switzerland), and Nilüfer (Turkey). For each case study, the findings reveal: (i) a unique multistakeholder composition, (ii) diverse preferences on business/social models, (iii) a regular presence of the fifth helix as intermediaries, and (iv) the willingness to experiment with democratic arrangements beyond the hegemonic PPP. © 2020 European Commission.

abstract={Purpose: Entrepreneurial intention plays a crucial role in the research and application of social entrepreneurship (SE). The purpose of this paper is to investigate the influence of the factors affecting students’ intention towards social entrepreneurship (ISE). The study has taken entrepreneurial self-efficacy, along with entrepreneurial education, entrepreneurial network and perceived university support that have an impact on intentions, which instills interest amongst students in being future entrepreneurs. Design/methodology/approach: Data were primarily taken from a survey of 380 university students from public and private universities in Chattogram, the business capital of Bangladesh. Students were preliminarily selected, focussing on different profiles such as male/female, age, socio-economic status, education level, university status and employment level. Initially, using factor analysis factors were analyzed and later multiple regression analysis was used to identify the relationship with ISE. Findings: The study on the student reveals that four aspects significantly impacted the preference of students’ ISE. This study reinforces the influence of entrepreneurial self-efficacy, along with entrepreneurial education, as the factors contributing to aid young graduates recognizing and fostering an ISE. Entrepreneurial networks and perceived university support were found to have no association with social entrepreneurial intentions. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the understanding of the factors and provides a basis for explaining factors that affect the intention of students towards SE. It can contribute to future research related to social entrepreneurial intention. Furthermore, it was concluded that forming social entrepreneurial intention is highly influenced by entrepreneurial self-efficacy and entrepreneurship education. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Situated at the intersection of urban and economic geography, this paper develops and illustrates a three-step research agenda to further critical understanding of relations between crowdfunding and cities. First, we explore how crowdfunding is enrolled in shifting programmes of urban governance that valorize entrepreneurship in North America and Europe in particular. When invoked in urban governance, crowdfunding is increasingly the ‘go to’ method for mobilizing the cash, capital and collective enthusiasm necessary for social entrepreneurship and civic renewal in cities. Second, we offer a situated, qualitative case study account of crowdfunding in Berlin. In contrast with existing research, we show how a specific urban context contributes to shaping the distinctive crowdfunding ecologies that emerge in a city. Third, we interrogate the multiplicity and diversity of crowdfunding-city relations, identifying and analyzing three distinctive ecologies that have emerged to date in Berlin. While crowdfunding is indeed enabling social entrepreneurship in particular ways in Berlin, it also contributes to capitalizing speculation in booming real-estate developments and facilitates the solidarity economies of community groups and charities. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Using the UP Bike Share (UPBS), a university-based bicycle-sharing social enterprise (in Metro Manila, Philippines) as a case study, this paper aims to bring a more explicit social entrepreneurship perspective towards sustainability transitions research as well as draw insights from social enterprise as a social innovation to challenge existing sociotechnical regimes. Existing operator models of bike-sharing systems in other countries are predominantly for-profit vendors, publicly-owned entities and non-profit organizations. Emerging from civil society, UP Bike Share, on the other hand, is a social enterprise that grew into a social movement with a well-defined advocacy, and became part of a bigger social movement of sustainability advocates. Where previous attempts to establish a bike-sharing program by the local government, international development institution and public transport agency in Metro Manila failed, the UP Bike Share represents the first bike-sharing system in the Philippines that was successfully piloted, implemented and sustained. We then expound on three mechanisms by which UP Bike Share can achieve such transformation, namely: market formation, insertion into the broader social movement, and replication of innovation in other localities, supporting wider sustainability goals. We end with agenda for future research. © 2020},

In light of this, this article explores the potential of SE international expansion as a catalyst for scaling social impact across borders. From our reading of the literature, we discern three major typologies of cross-border scaling: Control-based, altruism-based, and hybrid. Drawing on a multiple-case study of nine international SEs, we examine why and how SEs deploy these scaling strategies on an international scale; the challenges to maximize social impact across borders associated with each of the scaling strategies, and the resources and actions that SEs can mobilize to manage such challenges associated with international expansion. Contrary to conventional wisdom and mainstream theory depicting SEs as small-sized organizations that suffer from different limitations to expand beyond their traditional national boundaries, our findings illustrate how these organizations can successfully operate on an international scale and simultaneously generate financial, social, and environmental value. © 2020 by The Authors.},

Design/methodology/approach: The methodology includes trend, regression, and correlation analysis and scenario (imitation) modeling and elaborates on perspectives and recommendations for further development of social entrepreneurship in Russia and Asia. Findings: Despite the active development of social entrepreneurship in Russia and Asian countries (its share in the structure of GDP of these countries constituted 2.6% on average in 2018), it accounts for a small contribution to domestic development of socio-economic systems. These countries of Asia in 2018 were peculiar for low level of social freedoms (70th position in the world), low level of healthcare (51st position), moderate level of ecological effectiveness (61.33 points out of 100), moderate level of education (0.767 points out of 1) and low level of development of infrastructure (39 points out of 100). In the provision of social freedoms and healthcare, social entrepreneurship is least developed and is peculiar for a tendency for a decrease. The difference between demand and offer of social entrepreneurship causes an imbalance of the market of social (non-profit, volunteer and charity) services in these countries. This imbalance is to be overcome with the recent tendency of digitization of social entrepreneurship in Russia and Asian countries. Originality/value: Digitization occupies the last position among the factors of the development of social entrepreneurship. Tax stimulation of social entrepreneurship is preferable, so it is recommended to pay primary attention to it until 2022, for the provision of the balance of the market of social services. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The article, therefore, examines selected characteristics of social enterprises, namely social value, innovations, and market activities. In addition, differences in the start-up and operational phases of social enterprises were measured. Social enterprises must operate in a specific business context, which essentially hinders or promotes social entrepreneurship. As culture differs between north-western and south-eastern Europe, it is important to examine the differences in social entrepreneurship between these two groups of countries. To analyze the proposed characteristics, we used the latest data from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor special report on social entrepreneurship. The results indicate that there exist differences in social impact measurement between observed groups of countries. Additionally, we confirmed differences between the observed groups of countries in terms of innovations and market activity of social enterprises in the operational phase. Our results also suggest that social entrepreneurship is more developed in north-western European countries than in south-eastern ones, with some elements in the north-western countries being more noticeable in the operational phase compared to the start-up phase. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={Background: Social entrepreneurship is a growing trend that reflects a shift in contemporary policy towards entrepreneurship and self-employment as viable employment option for people with disabilities. Entrepreneurship is intended to promote autonomy and reduce dependence on entitlement-based services as well as reduce employment disparities while stimulating business and job creation.However, it is not well understood what exactly this means for people with intellectual disabilities (ID) involved in social entrepreneurial ventures. Methods: Dyadic interviews were conducted with people with ID participating in social entrepreneurship (n = 7) as well as with the person they identified as instrumental in providing support (n = 7). Interviews focused on understanding the management processes used by people with ID, or “how they act” in negotiating between formal and informal systems of services and supports and barriers encountered. Results: Themes that emerged include the main barriers they experienced, how their businesses are organized; and the use of formal and informal services and supports. Conclusions: This research expands upon our understanding of social entrepreneurship and the management processes involved in customized employment for people with ID. It offers new insights and information for practitioners, policymakers, and researchers to inform the expectations we set for entrepreneurship as a sustainable employment option, from the perspective of social entrepreneurs with ID themselves. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={Purpose: Entrepreneurial orientation (EO) has been viewed almost exclusively through the lens of profit-driven firms. However, individuals engage in entrepreneurship not only for economic reasons but also to enrich a community or to advance society. Drawing on upper echelons theory, the purpose of this paper is to address this issue by proposing that founders’ social identities shape the strategic choices of their ventures. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on the data from 318 founders in the early stages of their entrepreneurial activity, the study applies partial least squares structural equation modeling to empirically test whether founders’ social identities influence their ventures’ EO. Findings: The findings of the current research show that founders whose dominant purpose is the creation of value for others are more likely to launch ventures oriented toward innovation. On the other hand, ventures of founders driven by economic self-interest accept more risk, which leads to higher performance outcomes on the enterprise, community and societal levels. Originality/value: The study enhances the EO discussion by adding social identity theory as a way to explain different levels of EO in firms and answers the call for more diversity in EO–performance measurement by applying specific outcomes on the enterprise, community and societal levels to investigate whether a firm’s EO leads to the desired outcomes. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This enables advances in the scientific literature and the design of more effective policies that encourage the creation of social enterprises. To achieve this goal, after delimiting the area of study, a sample of 25,631 entrepreneurs in 59 countries was used; 9792 of these are social entrepreneurs collected by the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor project in 2015 when a special issue focused on this topic.

abstract={Social entrepreneurship is an entrepreneurial activity centering on solving social problems and creating social values, which can effectively alleviate the problems of sustainable development such as an excessive gap between the rich and the poor, a lack of resources and so on, and can resolve the "triple failures" of government, the market and public welfare departments to a certain extent. As the subjective attitude of entrepreneurs, entrepreneurial intention can predict a representational incidence rate of entrepreneurial behavior. Therefore, aimed at university students, a special group of entrepreneurs, this paper constructs a theoretical framework of "network embeddedness - sense of opportunity identification efficacy - university students' social entrepreneurial intention" from the perspective of social cognitive theory through 466 pieces of valid survey data, and uses Stata 14 to construct a multiple linear regression model to explore the mechanism of action between the three. The results show that university students' sense of opportunity identification efficacy can significantly and positively stimulate their social entrepreneurial intention, and the network embeddedness (network scale and network intensity) of entrepreneurs is also significantly and positively correlated with their sense of opportunity identification efficacy; however, via the hierarchical regression model, it was found that the sense of opportunity identification efficacy can only partially mediate the relationship between network embeddedness and university students' social entrepreneurial intention, which is mainly manifested in the positive correlation between university students' social entrepreneurial intention and their network scale, and is unrelated to network intensity. This research contributes to enriching the theory of social entrepreneurial intention and guides the strengthening of university students' social entrepreneurial intention in reality. © 2019 Wang, Tang, Liu, Zheng, Liu and Liu.},

abstract={Entrepreneurship education is a very important issue in the digital age. It aims to enable learners and society to respond to emergent economic and employment challenges. When entrepreneurs struggle to launch and sustain a new venture, the key question usually is not a lack of relevant knowledge, but the necessary fortitude and attitude to face down difficulties and challenges. Thus, entrepreneurs require development in the affective domain. However, most of courses emphasize the cognition and psychomotor functions, but neglect the affective domain. This study attempts to combine entrepreneurial Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and blended curriculum design for affective learning. A total of 32 students participated in a 9-week social entrepreneurship program. Content analysis was used for comparison of the learning performance. The findings suggest that social entrepreneurship courses can be effectively used to help learners achieve learning objectives of different affective levels, but this is a time-intensive process, particularly for higher levels. The affective development of the final level takes longer to achieve; therefore, course designers should adopt a spiral structure which frequently revisits concepts in the last three levels. Moreover, MOOCs are designed for mass usage, and treat all learners uniformly. MOOCs' course content should be supplemented and adjusted according to specific course goals and student needs. © 2019 Wu, Kao, Wu and Wei.},

abstract={While Cyprus is a significant destination, it is mainly characterised by mass tourism, focusing on seascape and leaving rural areas undeveloped. This situation, creates challenges related to its sustainability, such as unequal development, impacts on residents' well-being, and decreased competitiveness. Employing a qualitative research approach, through interviews with fourteen policy makers, high-level administrators, and tourist officials, as well as document analysis, the study examines the role of Cyprus' rural tourism on its residents' well-being. Findings indicate that Cyprus' rural tourism takes the forms of agricultural, cultural and religious, nature-based, and event tourism. While rural tourism is recognised as a sustainable niche, challenges such as its fragmented nature, inappropriate management, lack of knowledge, and microinterests, hinder its appreciation. The paper concludes with a framework suggesting three strategies that will lead to the islands' competitiveness and residents' well-being: Integrated Rural Tourism, valorisation of social entrepreneurship, and identification of rural destinations' capitals. © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={Purpose: This paper aims to contribute to the lack of research on female social entrepreneurs and their social and contextual embeddedness, promoting women’s social entrepreneurial activity as promising, specifically in the South African context. Design/methodology/approach: By analyzing the founding process and networks of 11 female social entrepreneurs in South Africa using a mixed-method approach consisting of semi-structured interviews, media analysis and egocentric network analysis, this paper seeks to discover the idea-fruition process of female social entrepreneurs. This approach enables us to analyze contextual factors with a focus on personal networks and their influence on the processes of idea-generation and development. Findings: The results indicate that social networks are an important part of the personal context which influences the idea-fruition process of female social entrepreneurs. The paper identifies specific actors as well as group outcomes as particular relevant within this context. Research limitations/implications: While the results enable the generation of a structure based on the authors’ first insights into how social relational networks influence female social entrepreneurship, it remains unclear if these results can be specifically traced to women or social entrepreneurial aspects, which suggests that further attention is needed in future studies. Practical implications: Practical implications can be derived from the results concerning the support of female social entrepreneurs by, for example, optimizing or using their (social entrepreneurial) environment. Contrary to studies on business idea-generation, the results stress that women can make use of certain network constructions that are often considered to be obstructive. Originality/value: This study introduces an innovative gender perspective on social entrepreneurship in South Africa and offers new directions for future research on the opportunity recognition process of female social entrepreneurs. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

To date, research on social enterprise innovation has predominantly focused on micro-level factors, such as the social entrepreneur or organizational attributes. Inversely, recent empirical advances on social enterprise find a country’s social enterprise sector is influenced by macro-institutional factors, including form of government, stage of economic development, culture and model of civil society (Monroe-White and Coskun, in: Shaping social enterprise: understanding institutional context and influence, Emerald Publishing Limited, London, pp 27–48, 2017). Given the link between social enterprise and innovation, recent empirical findings around social enterprise beg the question, do macro-institutional factors similarly predict innovation by social enterprises? This paper uses a hierarchical linear model to examine the influence of national-level variables on social enterprise innovation. Results indicate that similar to social enterprise, macro-institutional factors predict social enterprise innovation. More specifically, macro-institutional factors influence the various types of innovations (product, process and marketing) differently. Moreover, country-level innovation is traditionally defined by economic factors, such as R&D funding and STEM workforce, however, these factors do not help explain social enterprise innovation. Given the social aspects of social enterprise innovation, to capture the full scope of innovation within countries, expanded definitions of national-level innovation should be considered. © 2018, International Society for Third-Sector Research and The Johns Hopkins University.},

abstract={“Tourism-Assisting the Poor” has been an important approach in anti-poverty strategy. Studies suggest that the conventional tourism model fails to generate benefits for the poor and to some extent enlarges the gap between the poor and the rich, which subsequently causes more social problems. Pro-poor tourism (PPT) is regarded as an alternative model. Precisely targeted assistance to the poor is the key to initiating this model, while the institutional change and implementation mechanism are essential to run it successfully and sustainably. Social entrepreneurship focusing on social values while adopting modern business philosophy has been introduced recently as an instrument in helping disadvantage population. This paper takes the Smangus community in Taiwan as an example to explore the role of social entrepreneurship and social enterprises in PPT development. It also discusses their implications for the anti-poverty practice in other regions including ethnic areas in China. © 2018, © 2018 Shandong Normal University.},

abstract={This paper introduces a new approach to social entrepreneurship, namely systems map, to determine the path of achievement of a social enterprise's objectives. The paper uses the case-study approach. First, the factors that contribute towards the achievement of an enterprise's objectives are identified from the literature. The applicability of these factors to the case is discussed using primary data. Furthermore, the inter-linkages amongst these factors are determined and verified with data, with their final outcome being a social impact. Social impact-centric system map is the first such attempt to develop a tool for measurement of determinants of the progress of social enterprise. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Purpose: This study aims to explore the shift in social and cultural values in the wake of ongoing change; specifically, the degree of embeddedness of these values among farm-based entrepreneurs. The authors examine how this value-change-embeddedness continuum can further the development of theories in the field of social entrepreneurship. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use an exploratory and a descriptive approach when interviewing eight farmers and members of their respective households. The sample encompasses almost all the providers of farm-based tourism in this particular area of rural Norway. The empirical materials form the basis for selecting our theoretical approach, one of which is a structural life-mode analysis. Findings: The findings show that the social value of self-reliance, when taken to extremes, can hinder the growth of deeper commercial cooperation between farmers. This constitutes a challenge to efficiency and effectiveness on a larger scale, given a need for both independence and interdependence together with flexible entrepreneurial network cooperation in social entrepreneurship. The findings also indicate that social entrepreneurship does not necessarily have to include a cognitive shift in values and roles for the exclusion of a productive entrepreneurial identity. Originality/value: By focusing on value changes in social entrepreneurship, this paper addresses a significant gap in the entrepreneurship literature relating to the process of value creation. By using the structural life-mode analysis, this study identifies the underlying value changes that are fundamental to entrepreneurial processes, allowing that process to unfold and take hold to the betterment of affected farm-based communities. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

The New York project coined the term “Inclusive Entrepreneurship” to describe a model that promoted change at the individual, program, and systems level to improve the rate of small business development by people with disabilities. The author describes the genesis of the project, its intended effects and the lessons learned along the way that resulted in either course corrections or improvements, He then discusses how the project has been sustained and provides recommendations for replicating the project’s approach and methods in other United States communities or in other countries. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.},

General Self Efficacy Scale-Turkish Form and Pre-service Teachers' Entrepreneurship Characteristics Scale was applied to collect data. The study revealed that effort and persistence which are general self-efficacy dimensions predicted personal creativity and risk-taking features of social entrepreneurship. According to the findings of the study, initiative, effort and persistence dimensions predict the self-confidence which is a characteristic of social entrepreneurship. Finally it can be suggested that practices oriented to developing self-efficacy beliefs and social entrepreneurship characteristics should take a part in teacher training programs as these practices may help teachers about how to teach students various skills. © Manchester University Press.},

abstract={Objective: Based on extensive literature review, this paper aims to establish if, why and how, in given environmental and market contexts, social entrepreneurship (SE) opportunities are discovered and exploited. It positions social problems as sources of entrepreneurial opportunity. The article presents an integrated process-based view of SE opportunity antecedents and concludes with a dynamic model of SE opportunity. Research Design & Methods: To fulfil its goal, the paper establishes opportunity as unit of research and explores the dynamics of opportunity recognition. To identify the components of SE opportunity through a process-based view, the study follows the steps of critical literature review method. The literature review follows with logical reasoning and inference, which results in the formulation of a model proposition of social entrepreneurship opportunity. Findings: The paper presents a holistic perspective on opportunity antecedents in SE context and introduces social problems, information, social awareness and entrepreneurial mindset as fundamental components of social entrepreneurship opportunity equation. Implications & Recommendations: It is necessary to remember for policy makers, investors and partners involved within the social sector, that social problems can be the source of entrepreneurial opportunity. Training, assisting and engaging socially aware entrepreneurs is a promising line of development for all communities. Contribution & Value Added: The major contribution of this study lies in extending the existing body of social entrepreneurship research by providing a new perspective, placing social problem as opportunity in the centre of the discussion. © 2018, Cracow University of Economics.

abstract={A persistent, nagging question among social entrepreneurs and those who research social entrepreneurs is why some social enterprises scale while others do not. Of late, much credit has been given to design innovation, design thinking, fast pivots and the Business Model Canvas. But what if we are placing too much emphasis on design innovation and pivoting, and missing other key important factors that help social enterprises scale quickly? While innovation is clearly important, and arguably a necessary baseline, the authors' interviews with successful social entrepreneurs have pointed more to the importance of sourcing financial capital, building out their supply chain - both in production and distribution - and obtaining early media recognition. These three factors created a virtuous cycle, allowing these firms to increase their revenues, employees and impact substantially each year during their first four years after founding.},

abstract={In this chapter we offer an integrated framework for poverty alleviation that maps the roles of private sector, government and civil society organizations. For private sector enterprises and social entrepreneurs, strategies to engage the poor go well beyond selling to consumers and include working with the poor as valuable sources of information, as producers and suppliers, as employees and as distributors. We argue that the greatest impact that companies or social enterprises can have in reducing poverty is to create productive jobs for low-income individuals. We also emphasize the important role for local small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to generate employment. Our integrated model also seeks to bring the essential role of government into the conversation on business and poverty alleviation. We outline government role in providing public services, infrastructure, regulation and facilitating job creation as essential for market-based approaches to poverty alleviation. Civil society can play an important role as a catalyst and watchdog to ensure that both the private sector and governments live up to societal regulations and expectations. With an understanding of the various roles and approaches of societal actors, social entrepreneurs and their partners can make realistic progress towards the complex tasks of social and environmental innovation while genuinely addressing poverty alleviation and bring us closer to a globally inclusive market system that creates value for all. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

Given that creating social value is one of the main goals of social entrepreneurs, social entrepreneurship is especially important in today's economic climate, characterised by a severe global crisis that has affected the role of the welfare state for a host of economic agents. Consequently, it is highly advisable to devise measures to foster social entrepreneurship by addressing the key variables that drive this activity. This study's aim was to analyse some of these variables, namely human capital and income distribution, as well as the institutional variables of the rule of law and corruption. To achieve this aim, the economic situation in 29 countries was studied using Partial Least Squares (PLS) methodology. Copyright © 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={The increasing social and environmental issues and challenges have become an imperative for businesses, governments and international community to be addressed, and failure to address these issues and challenges jeopardizes their ability to create prosperity and to be sustainable in the long-term for businesses and society as a whole. Sustainability has long been on the agenda at many companies, but for decades their social, environmental, and governance activities have been disconnected from core strategy. Most of companies still take a fragmented, reactive approach – launching ad hoc initiatives to enhance their “green” credentials, to comply with regulations, or to deal with emergencies – rather than treating sustainability as an issue with a direct impact on business results. The result of McKinsey’s survey on sustainability shows that only 36 % of executives say their companies have a strategic approach to it, with a defined set of initiatives (McKinsey 2011). The global stakeholders and constituents such as government, NGOs, and international community have become a major force in promoting social responsibility and environmental sustainability. They can provide integrated solutions across interconnected issues area such as economic, social, environmental, and security action. They can facilitate universal dialogue to arrive at joint solutions and mobilize new constituencies to join businesses, governments and international organizations to address global emerging issues and challenges, and they also can legitimize new norms, structures and processes for international cooperation on sustainable development. Now a global movement that aims to encourage businesses to pay closer attention to their social and environmental impact has gained momentum in recent years. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Yet, in the absence of research investigating those relationships, particularly at the community level of analysis, there is little empirical evidence to substantiate this claim. The research reported here adopts a case study approach in studying the effectiveness of a Canadian First Nations community whose purposive action to improve its well being is considered a strategic case of social entrepreneurship. While the change agents (who are members of the community) exercised considerable entrepreneurship, their endeavors did not positively impact the broader community's entrepreneurial capacity. In fact, the results suggest that the process has cultivated considerable dependency. A number of contributing factors are identified and discussed as are the implications. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Corporations are beholden to a deeply flawed system of corporate governance known as shareholder wealth maximization. This norm dictates that corporations optimize profits at all costs to compensate equity investors for their continued exposure to risk Other stakeholders in the corporate enterprise, like employees and consumers, are owed nothing outside of the contractual relationships they might possess, while the public at large is owed nothing at all Because courts continue to vigorously enforce this norm, corporations are largely excluded from providing public goods and services, while simultaneously incentivized to push harmful production costs onto communities and the environment. To cope with this outcome, disparate actors like non-profit organizations, the state, and consumers have intervened in the marketplace, with questionable effect. While it may be too late to do away with the shareholder wealth maximization system in traditional corporate entities, there is an alternative corporate structure that entrepreneurs and consumers can and should utilize to make capitalism work for the public good. This Note analyzes how the structure of the benefit corporation reunites profit seeking and the promotion of the public good in a single, private business entity. The benefit corporation mandates a hybrid purpose: profit and "material positive impact on society and the environment." In short, benefit corporations aspire to the rallying cry of the "social entrepreneur"-to do well while doing good. Critics, however, question the substantive enforcement mechanism of the benefit corporation, a third-party auditing standard that they self-apply to evaluate whether they are effectively providing for the public good. This Note concurs, but proposes a statutory construction and litigation strategy that courts and plaintiffs can apply to ensure that benefit corporations do not shirk their duty to the public. Through the express private right of action known as the "benefit enforcement proceeding," this Note contends that shareholders and dissenting directors can and should seek injunctive relief for breaches of the procedural "duty of consideration of non-shareholder interests" by the corporation and its board of directors.},

abstract={The concept of venture philanthropy has been greatly discussed by various parties especially among the policy makers. The increasing social problems call for corporations to respond positively and take responsibilities in the social sector. It encourages venture philanthropy activities among profit and non-profit organizations in enhancing business values and creating positive social impacts. There have been past studies that looked at how venture philanthropy concept can be linked with Islamic philanthropy. Islamic philanthropy includes but not limited to zakat, waqf and sadaqah. The instruments within Islamic philanthropy aim to serve the purpose of narrowing social distance and reducing inequalities. This conceptual paper aims to understand further the concept of venture philanthropy and how it links to Islamic philanthropy. This paper also aims to explore how venture philanthropy approach is applicable in enhancing waqf practices.},

Stewart, the most prominent social anthropologist in the entrepreneurship field, has elegantly drawn attention to the potential of introducing social anthropology to researching entrepreneurship. The chapter examines how far his recommendations have been taken up in the entrepreneurship field, particularly the use of a social anthropological philosophy as well as methods. It summarizes particularly the research of those entrepreneurship researchers who have had specialized training in anthropology and try to map the influence they have had. The chapter also considers work of researchers trained in other disciplines, but who have enthusiastically adopted anthropological approaches to their research. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Despite a widespread recognition in the mainstream entrepreneurship literature that many legitimate entrepreneurs do not pursue purely profit-driven commercial goals, the small but burgeoning literature on entrepreneurship in the informal economy has assumed entrepreneurs operating wholly or partially on an off-the-books basis are commercial rather than social entrepreneurs. To evaluate critically this assumption, evidence is reported from a survey involving face-to-face interviews with 70 informal entrepreneurs located in deprived and affluent urban and rural English localities. The finding is that informal entrepreneurs range from those pursuing purely commercial ends through to purely social entrepreneurs pursuing solely social logics, with the majority situated somewhere in-between combining both commercial and social objectives. The outcome is a call to recognize that not all informal entrepreneurs are purely commercial entrepreneurs and that the commercial versus social entrepreneurship dichotomy will need to be transcended if the multifarious goals underpinning informal entrepreneurship are to be better understood. © 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

One major objective in this conjunction is to assess the contribution of this cross-border co-operation to the development of Russia's social economy as well as to discuss the various obstacles that civil society actors face in developing co-operative projects. As such, organizational, social and technical issues are important areas to be addressed. However, civil society co-operation is not a mere technical issue; understanding of the social embeddedness of civil society are also necessary in order to promote social welfare agendas.

abstract={This article provides an introductory description of Italian green social cooperatives which are democratic nonprofit organizations specializing in the provision of environmental services. The background to this topic is the literature on the "third sector," usually called social entrepreneurship, and the "sociology of environment," mainly that part concerned with consumption and lifestyles. Green social cooperatives are a concrete attempt to unify the three pillars of sustainability. The analysis is divided into two parts. The first part highlights the challenges that the environmental crisis raises for social enterprises and considers three dimensions in particular: work integration, generalized or linear exchange, and the theory of the commons. The discussion reveals mismatches between the urgency of moving to-ward a sustainable world and the competences of social enterprises. The second part examines this asymmetry and uses the social cooperative, the main empirical expression of social enterprise in Italy, as its point of departure. The article proposes a typology with which to frame green social cooperatives and employs a qualitative approach to out-line a concrete case for each type. The result is the emergence of a social area, at present decidedly underdeveloped and undersized, but with considerable potential for job creation and environmental services. The analysis demonstrates that social enterprises are interesting hybrids of economic and social sustainability, but to promote the environmental pillar of sustainability they must combine work and habitation (or production and consumption) according to a logic of sufficiency. © 2012 Osti.},

abstract={In the extremely fluid space marked by the strongest economic crisis of the past 60 years, one can observe that the state and the Church became institutions undergoing major changes, while religion becomes shelter for the people in risk of social and economic exclusion. The world economic crisis which started in 2008 shows major changes in the public policies, particularly in the social policies, and the Church may play a major role for the support of the vulnerable groups, now that the budget allocations traditionally administered by the State decreased. With the intention to identify these changes in the religious structures from Romania, we attempted to analyse the data available with the Romanian Orthodox Church. Thus, the complementarity of the assistance to the vulnerable groups through the social programs developed by the Church is beneficial both for the state and for the Church itself due to the predominant social-philanthropic character of the support provided to the faithful people during this period of economic crisis. The paper also reveals the framework of the social entrepreneurship in relation with the religious structures and launches the challenge to continue capitalising on the relation between the expenditure for welfare coming from public funds and the different dimensions of religiousness, particularly by integrating the activities of social assistance.},

abstract={It has been suggested that the concept of danwei functions as a key structural element within Chinese urban society (R. Sévigny, S. Chen, and E.Y. Chen, 2009, Personal experience of schizophrenia and the role of danwei: a case study on 1990's Beijing, Cult Med Psychiatry, 33, 86-111). However, the relevance of the danwei to social entrepreneurship in China has not yet been identified let alone fully mapped out. Instead, the discourse relating to social entrepreneurship in China has typically been driven by Anglo-American models of entrepreneurship that emphasize novelty, whilst marginalizing the more established traditions of social movements within Chinese society. This has potentially significant implications for the concept, and project, of social entrepreneurship in China. In addition, western notions of social entrepreneurship can be enriched by the consideration of 'oriental' categories ofthought. This paper shows how the concept of social entrepreneurship tends to 'evolve in its specific environment' (J. Defourny and S.-Y. Kim, 2011, Emerging models of social enterprise in Eastern Asia: a cross-country analysis, Social enterprise journal, 7 (1), 86-111) and suggests that the evolution of the discourse and meanings of social entrepreneurship is rarely politically neutral or uncontested. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={This article presents a reflective perspective on the scope that social entrepreneurship offers to non-governmental development work in the Indian context. Beginning with the early corporate efforts to do good to society, the article outlines the history of nongovernmental action through its charity, community welfare, developmental and mobilisational and 'post-developmentalist neo-liberal political economy' phases. It then reviews the concept of social entrepreneurship as it has developed in Western liberal democracies where a rethinking of the welfare state has taken place. While the ideology of social entrepreneurship seems to reside naturally in the current phase, only some of its aspects seem to offer growth trajectories for non-governmental work in the near future. Though the foundations and trusts that the early business entrepreneurs established did provide the initial stratum for future non-governmental work, in recent times the charitable-philanthropic orientation of business has evolved into a socially entrepreneurial form, often involving partnerships with the third sector. For the mix of non-governmental organisations (NGOs), especially those which have political goals like empowerment and social justice, social entrepreneurship, in its strict form, seems to have little to offer. But key features of the social entrepreneurial process, namely socially entrepreneurial behaviour, and more importantly social innovation-new ways of solving social problems, resourcefulness, larger scale and wider impact and solutions that are transferable, scalable and cost-effective-are important future directions for all kinds of NGOs, including those whose primary thrust is empowerment and social justice. However, non-governmental organisations need to reaffirm the primacy of the civic in their purpose constantly-aware and positively critical of the ideological undercurrents that influence and shape their responses.},

Such teachers develop innovative practices that are tailored to their situations, in order to address issues like poor demand for education in the community; social barriers to enrolment, particularly of girls, social problems that spill into the educational domain; lack of resources for education and poor schooling environments. While the teachers do tend to form a new identity which is defined by a mix of educational and social leadership qualities, their social entre-preneurial and innovative behaviour tends to be circumscribed in its impact. A policy entrepreneurship focus that encourages diffusion processes, which are different from those of the innovation generation, allows the pooling and sharing of locally effective social entrepreneurship practices, and contributes to wider social impact.},

abstract={Social entrepreneurship is a business approach in which entrepreneurs focus on social problems. Social entrepreneurs generate new initiatives, provide social plans and marshal resources with regard to social problems. This study examines the opportunity recognition behavior and readiness of youth for social entrepreneurship as a career choice. The topic is not arranged systematically; hence, this research aims to organize the topic by combining opportunity recognition behavior and willingness of youth toward social entrepreneurship through comprehensive theoretical modeling and empirical testing. The study hypothesized that social capital, social empathy, normative institutional environment, formal education, and training may enhance opportunity recognition behavior, whereas the regulative institutional environment may harm youth opportunity recognition behavior. This study also hypothesized that opportunity recognition behavior can lead to the readiness of youth for social entrepreneurship. Non-probability purposive sampling technique has been used due to selective participation. The data for this research have been collected from Indian, Pakistani, and Chinese youth. A total of 750 questionnaires were distributed among respondents, and 555 were returned for further analysis. The findings conclude that Social Empathy and Education and Training within formal and informal environments hold strong influence while defining individuals' Social Entrepreneurial Intentions. © 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2019.},

abstract={The formation of a hybrid organizational identity is a significant challenge for many social enterprises. Drawing on in-depth longitudinal data from the first three years of a successful social enterprise – Fairphone, founded in Amsterdam – we induce an empirically grounded theoretical model of how a hybrid organizational identity is formed. We identify a general process of organizational identity formation, with founders, leaders and members experimenting with different organizational characters describing ‘who they are’ as well as with alternative social impact strategies defining ‘what they do’. As part of this experimental process, we elaborate the role of a key leadership process – ‘rekeying’, which involves leaders re-figuring prior understandings into more dual readings – which we found facilitates ongoing adaptation and helps members of the organization to become progressively better able at combining multiple objectives and values as part of a shared hybrid identity. Our theoretical model of hybrid organizational identity formation has a number of direct implications for ongoing research on organizational identity formation and hybrid organizations. © 2020 The Authors.

abstract={Purpose: Social entrepreneurial orientation (SEO) is an evolving concept. Though adequate literature has been accumulated about the concept, there is a lack of appropriate tool to measure individual SEO. The tools presently available mostly measure organizational SEO. The purpose of this study is to develop and validate a tool to measure the concept of individual SEO. Design/methodology/approach: Data for the study was collected using a questionnaire, from 342 randomly collected samples. Various time-tested methods and statistical techniques, including exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, were used to scientifically construct and validate the scale. Findings: In tune with the purpose of this study, a 4-factor, 13-item SEO scale has been developed and scientifically validated through various acceptable and proven techniques. The developed tool is ideal to measure the orientation toward social entrepreneurship. Originality/value: A review of literature revealed that there is paucity of a scientific tool to measure individual SEO. The study has succeeded in bridging this gap by constructing and validating a scale to measure SEO. This tool, it is expected, will help social scientists, academicians and researchers in conducting empirical examinations about SEO. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The daunting global challenges saddling polities and governments alike have resultantly created a situation whereby governments and corporate civil society have inadvertently reneged on delivering public good and services to citizens. In ensuring and strengthening a public–private actor synergy, with particular emphasis on leveraging acquired knowledge and skills of diaspora-based students, social entrepreneurship activities could be harnessed to provide sustainable remedies to social challenges such as unemployment, famine amongst others by utilizing social entrepreneurship as a tool. Using the theory of planned behaviour as a theoretical framework, the study elicited data from 322 respondents to empirically investigate determinants of social entrepreneurship intentions of Ghanaian students, with the moderating role of institutional support. Study results revealed that sense of social responsibility and service learning have significant relationship with social entrepreneurship intention. However, social volunteering experience had no significant relationship. Moreover, whereas attitude to social entrepreneurship intention demonstrated a positive relationship, institutional support as a moderator was also revealed to influence the relationship between attitude and social entrepreneurship intention. From the study findings, we discourse on the implications for social entrepreneurship in Ghana to policy makers and stakeholders. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd},

abstract={This paper aims at identifying the entrepreneurial opportunities for establishing innovative startups during and post COVID-19 crisis. To reach this goal, we conducted an exploratory study based on semi-structured interviews with 168 students who intend to involve themselves in entrepreneurship in their future career. The research started from the debates in literature regarding the huge negative impact of the COVID-19 crisis on economic development, which can jeopardize the achievement of United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The research findings confirm the results of other studies regarding the vulnerability of startups during crises, the reason why they have to refocus on innovative businesses, especially based on information and communication technology (ICT). Such businesses are considered incentives of sustainable development. Other ideas highlighted the importance of social entrepreneurship for the management of startups. It means that startups should develop strong relationships with employees but also with other stakeholders, like companies in the same industry, the public sector, academia, and citizens. In addition, changing the business culture aiming at developing green business could be an inexpensive solution for developing a sustainable entrepreneurial ecosystem. These empirical results have implications for both business and the academic environment, which should cooperate in order to overcome the crisis. Such an approach could be used in the long run in order to manage other crises and to develop sustainable business. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

For these reasons, they continuously face various resources constraints, yet their hybrid nature could be translated into an opportunity. The purpose of our study was to investigate how a hybrid organisation can overcome resource constraints in developing countries by exploiting their own hybrid nature. In the unique research setting offered by Kenyan social enterprises, we identified five creative approaches implemented by social enterprises. Finally, we present a grounded model that clearly explains which hybrid harvesting strategies can be implemented to overcome resource constraints, exploiting their hybrid potential. Our work contributes to knowledge about resource constraints in the social entrepreneurship literature and extends social bricolage theory. Limitations and future research approaches are also presented. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={Purpose: Despite recent advances in research on antecedents of social entrepreneurial intentions, founder social identity has rarely been part of the research effort. This paper aims to investigate how different types of founder social identity affect social entrepreneurial intentions (SE intentions). Design/methodology/approach: This study investigates how different types of founder social identity, such as Darwinians, Communitarians and Missionaries, affect SE intentions. Specifically, this study predicts that entrepreneurs with Darwinian identity would be less likely to form SE intentions, while those with Missionary and Communitarian identities would be more prone to form SE intentions. The hypotheses are tested on a sample of 725 individuals recruited using Amazon Mechanical Turk. Most of the hypotheses, except for Communitarian identity, are supported by the data analysis. The results contribute to the literature on founder social identity and SE intentions and demonstrate that founder social identity is one of the important antecedents of social entrepreneurial intentions. Findings: Two of the hypotheses were supported by the results. Specifically, this study found a positive relation between Missionary founder social identity (its locus of self-definition is “Impersonal-We”) and social entrepreneurial intentions. This research also confirms that Darwinian founder social identity (its locus of self-definition is “I”) has a negative impact on social entrepreneurial intentions. Originality/value: First, a person’s social identity has been largely overlooked in social entrepreneurship intention literature (Bacq and Alt, 2018; Hockerts, 2017; Zaremohzzabieh et al, 2019). The findings provide the empirical evidence that individual-level antecedents, especially one’s membership in a social group (i.e. social identity), exert a significant impact on the formation of SE intentions. Second, among the two types of founder social identity predicted to have a positive influence on SE intentions, only Missionary identity was found to have such a positive impact. The typical Communitarian locus of self-definition of “Personal We,” is less influential than the self-definition of the typical Missionary locus of “Impersonal We.” This might imply that not all types of feelings of belonging to a community have a positive impact on the formation and development of social entrepreneurial intentions. Finally, this study found that Darwinians are less likely to pursue social entrepreneurship although the definition of Darwinians is close to the definition of traditional entrepreneurs (e.g. profit/opportunity seekers). This may signify that the traditional concept of entrepreneurship may not be enough to explain different types of entrepreneurial motivations (e.g. social vs commercial entrepreneurship). © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Some researchers blame it for disrupting financial ecosystem and while others admire it for redefining traditional business models. According to the Statista Report 2018, transaction value in the crowdfunding segment amounts to US$ 5,250 mn in 2018. The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of FinTech applications and crowdfunding on customer retention in Islamic banks of Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates. A structured questionnaire consisting of 31 items was designed to gather data from 535 customers of selected banks from both countries through strata sampling. Various statistical tests were done to check the association between FinTech applications including crowdfunding and customer retention using SPSS 25.0. The results indicated that financing application of FinTech has no relevance to customer retention while as other variables such as payments, advisory services, compliance and crowdfunding has an impact on retaining customers in Islamic banks of these two countries. The conclusion of this study emphasis on expanding the range of applications of FinTech services by Islamic banks so that the customer will stay longer with the bank. Also, crowdfunding should be integrated into the Islamic banking system so that it can help in social entrepreneurship, micro-finance and establishing global Zakah and Sadaqa system. © 2020 Management Development Institute.},

abstract={Purpose: This paper aims to characterise the “social” in social entrepreneurship (SE) by examining social value creation (SVC) from the perspective of vulnerable beneficiaries within a developing country context. It uses the lens of care ethics to garner insights into SVC based on what beneficiaries care about in their work engagement with social enterprises. Design/methodology/approach: The exploratory paper implements a multiple case study approach to theory building, which considers the rich, real-life developing country context wherein much SVC occurs. Data collection primarily uses in-depth interviews with beneficiaries in accordance with socially sensitive research methodologies involving vulnerable participants. Findings: The findings offer an ethical view of SVC that is premised on what is of value to beneficiaries in SE. The authors find that SVC is a multi-dimensional and reciprocal process that is shaped as beneficiaries work for social enterprises. The reciprocal nature of the process engenders beneficiary altruism, which may heighten vulnerability and lead to the dark side of SE. Social implications: Many of the problems SE tries to address are situated in developing countries. The findings may enable social entrepreneurs, policymakers and social enterprise organisations to develop more responsive and more impactful solutions to social problems in developing countries. They further suggest that beneficiaries must not be looked upon merely as passive recipients of value but as active participants in the SVC process. Originality/value: This paper contributes to critical SE discourse by giving voice to beneficiaries in SE. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: Existing public–private partnership (PPP) literature that explicitly adopts neo-institutional theory, tends to elucidate the impact of isomorphic pressures and organizational fields and structuration on PPP projects. This paper advances this literature by presenting the institutional work and micro-level dynamics through which actors initiate and implement a new form of project delivery. The authors show how actors enact responses to institutional structuration in the expansion and transformation of an airport from a public entity into a PPP in Saudi Arabia. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use a single case study design that offers an empirically rich and thick description of events such as the dynamic processes, practices and types of institutional work carried out by actors and organizations to deliver the project under investigation. Findings: Religious symbolic work as social integration triggered system integration work, which expanded the power capabilities of individual actors leading the project. Repair work then followed to alleviate the negative effects of disempowering the agency of actors negatively affected by the PPP model and to streamline the project implementation process. Practical implications: This research offers several practical implications. For PPPs to operate successfully in contexts similar to the Gulf region, policymakers should provide strong political support and be willing to bear a considerable risk of losses or minimal outcomes during the early phases of experimentation with PPPs. Also, policymakers should not only focus their attention on technical requirements of PPPs but also associate new meanings with the normative and cultural-cognitive elements that are integral to the success of PPP implementation. In order to design strategies for change that are designed to fit the unique cultural and sociopolitical settings of each country, policymakers should empower capable individual actors and provide them with resources and access to power, which will enable them to enforce changes that diverge from institutionalized practices. Social implications: This research connected the PPP literature with theoretical frameworks drawn from neo-institutional theory and power. It would be valuable for further research, however, to connect ideas from the PPP literature with other disciplines such as psychology and social entrepreneurship. PPP research examines a recent phenomenon that can potentially be combined with non-traditional streams of research in analyzing projects. Expanding the realm of PPP research beyond traditional theoretical boundaries could potentially yield exciting insights into how the overall institutional and psychological environments surrounding projects affect their initiation and implementation. Originality/value: The paper contributes new insights regarding the roles of religious symbolic work, allied with social and system integration of power relations in implementing PPP projects. It suggests a theoretical shift from structures and organizational fields – macro- and meso-levels of analysis – to individuals – micro-level – as triggers of new forms of project delivery that break with the status quo. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Recently, radical democratic initiatives have been undertaken by freelancers and founders who come together in a range of alternative forms such as ethical entrepreneurial coalitions, urban coworking spaces, and open cooperative networks. In this paper, we argue that these initiatives to invent alternative, more equal forms of organizing engage strongly with relational activities to replace hierarchical interaction with distributed peer collaboration. While the literature has emphasized the sense of experimentation and reflexivity of these alternative forms of organizing, this paper especially draws attention to the affective dynamics of everyday peer-to-peer collaboration. Drawing on an 18-month ethnography of a cooperative network of social entrepreneurs, we use a practice-based approach to study peer collaboration as a relational practice formed through a nexus of ‘weaving,’ ‘sharing,’ and ‘caring’ activities. Focusing on the affective orders enveloping relational practice, we document how the practice of peer collaboration is imbued by what we call an ‘affective oscillation’ forming contrasting amplitudes between confidence and frustration, exuberance and anxiety, and trust and exhaustion. As our core contribution, we problematize how the affirmative intent of radical democratic organizing is potentially jeopardized by this ‘cloudy affectivity,’ and we conclude that the collective pursuit of embodied ethical encounters is formed by slowing down and feeling into affective oscillation. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={Mainstream enterprises function by alleviating the cognitive burdens on their members and hence generating an insensitivity to all those complex environmental factors, in which they critically depend. By focusing on the political, institutional dynamics, the present article dwells on the questions of: How can social enterprises regain the embeddedness to the political, institutional environment and how can this process quest the dominant, institutional closure? To address these questions, the article introduces a synergy between new institutionalism and systems theory, both macro-sociological approaches that can compensate for each other’s deficiencies. In this context, the hybrid concept of institutional entrepreneurship describes the institutionalization of new organizational forms via the embeddedness of the institutional logics that underpin them. An in-depth qualitative research of the OTELO social enterprise and of its institutional framework of Mühlviertel was conducted. Empirical evidence shows that social entrepreneurship can regain the institutionally sustainability by becoming embedded to the fields of legitimacy, politics and discourse, and through this process dispute the broader institutional closeness. © 2019, International Society for Third-Sector Research.},

abstract={Community-based human service organizations (“HSOs”) employ a variety of strategies in delivering effective services and supporting vulnerable groups. Research has focused on the role of social entrepreneurship in realizing the potential of HSOs to enact change on a wider scale. However, studies in this field remain fragmented and unsynthesized. Addressing this gap, the following study employs scoping review methodology to systematically assess current knowledge while integrating findings into a model representing organizational factors and characteristics that have been found to lead to social entrepreneurship in community-based HSOs, or “Social Entrepreneurial Orientation”. Coded data from selected articles were developed into a conceptual map that included social innovation (product-based, process-based, and socially transformative social innovations), risk-taking, proactivity (planning and forecasting), and market orientation. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Within both society and education, economic and social entrepreneurship is considered to be of great importance. However, there appear to exist different and contradictory principles regarding the essence of this entrepreneurship. On the one hand, entrepreneurship is associated with economical concepts like competition, individual achievement and commodification. On the other hand, entrepreneurship is associated with collaboration, sharing and collective endeavors. The different notions and rationales represent a dilemma from an educational perspective, in the sense that the students may find themselves split between individual and collaborative methods and ideals. In this study, this dilemma is explored through a case study conducted in collaboration with students from the field of Social Education. The case study indicates that ambivalent notions about entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation entail a number of pedagogical challenges and produce occasional frustration among students. Especially, the students demonstrate different attitudes towards the concept of sharing ideas with their peers. At the end of the article, further educational implications of the study are discussed. © 2018, © 2018 Scandinavian Journal of Educational Research.},

abstract={In recent years, social farming has developed into an opportunity for income diversification in the South Tyrolean agricultural sector. In the northern Italian province, predominantly women farmers implement the provision of social services on farms. Starting from rural gender studies and women empowerment-literature, we hypothesize that social farming promotes the empowerment of the involved women. Accordingly, our study investigates the recognized impacts of offering farm-based childcare services on three types of power: power to, power with, and power within. In order to test our hypothesis, we conducted semi-structured interviews with seven women farmers that provide childcare services and with four experts. The results show that the provision of childcare services has enhanced the autonomy of women farmers and has had positive impacts on their skills and competences. This activity has changed their social role in the community by revalorizing rural lifestyles and by enabling the reconciliation of work and personal life for working mothers. Nevertheless, women farmers have recognized some negative effects on their workload, and on their interfamilial as well as other social relations. Finally, the study discusses the relationship between the specific ethno-linguistic context in South Tyrol and the effects of the activity of childcare provision on women farmers' empowerment. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Alternative food movements work to create more environmentally and economically sustainable food systems, but vary widely in their advocacy for social, racial and environmental justice. However, even those food justice activists explicitly dedicated to equity must respond to the unintended consequences of their work. This paper analyzes the work of activists in Oakland, CA, who have increasingly realized that their gardens, health food stores and farm-to-table restaurants play a role in what scholars have called green gentrification, the upscaling of neighborhoods through the creation of environmental amenities. Gentrification has had grave consequences for the low-income communities of color that food justice activists seek to serve. Activists are reflexive about this dynamic, and have developed strategies to push back against displacement. Most commonly, non-profit organizations and individual social entrepreneurs found businesses that seek to raise the profile of people of color in the trendy Oakland food scene while employing long-term residents in well-paying, green jobs. However, while these efforts are an essential component of a broader agenda to create both food justice and development without displacement, even these relatively high paying (when compared to the industry standard) “good food jobs” cannot keep up with escalating rents. For this reason, we also highlight the direct action and policy-oriented strategies engaged by a smaller number of food justice activists, and argue that these are necessary compliments to a market-based approach. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={Collaborative marketing for the sustainable development of community-based tourism enterprises (CBTEs) is subject to diverse stakeholder perspectives and a complex mix of factors determining collaboration success. This research investigates a framework supporting stakeholder collaborations in marketing CBTEs for sustainable development. The proposed framework is an outcome of the process of reconciling divergent perspectives in CBTE collaborative marketing using a knowledge co-production approach. Particularly, knowledge interactions between researchers and research participants to achieve a synthesis of perspectives in developing a collaborative marketing approach for the sustainable development of CBTEs in Vietnam were investigated. The knowledge interaction occurred in the form of a workshop that included 15 CBTE stakeholders and the first author and was undertaken in the village of Triem Tay (Vietnam). Through the workshop, a collaborative marketing framework for CBTE sustainability was identified. The framework stated the reasons for the divergence of perspectives on CBTE collaborative marketing for sustainable development: limited understanding of involved stakeholders; individuality in collective efforts; stakeholder self-righteousness; and contextual factors. Accordingly, the framework identified four attributes supporting stakeholders collaborations in marketing CBTEs for sustainable development: improved and right-directed perspectives of CBTE stakeholders; a set of rules governing stakeholder interventions; government involvement in CBTE collaborative marketing in the roles of an inspirer and an arbitrator; and the transformation from successful tour operators to social entrepreneurship to facilitate CBTE collaborative marketing. The contribution of this study lies in the potential of a knowledge co-production approach to be utilised in collaborative works involving multiple perspectives. Additionally, the study provides insights into the discussion of community-based tourism collaboration. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={The traditional literature regarding social entrepreneurship does not question the political dimension. On the contrary, it tends to de-politicize societal issues. A growing number of researchers underline how this perspective cannot address the complexity and the dialogical nature of social entrepreneurship. However, while there may be a case for incorporating a political perspective, there is currently no conceptual framework to systematically inform an empirical exploration of the role played by the political vision of entrepreneurs. In this paper, we use the concept of political ideology to offer a solid framework to show how politics can shape social entrepreneurs’ motivations. More precisely we identify three political profiles–anti-statist, reformist and neoliberal–which shape the motives to engage in social entrepreneurship. We take an embedded case study approach of 17 social entrepreneurs involved in a social innovation boot camp and reveal the existence of both, left and right-wing approaches in social entrepreneurship. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={A new form of coin-operated or electronic card-operated water vending machine; popularly known as the water ATMs (Automated Teller Machine) are gaining popularity as a ‘smart’ yet a ‘low-cost’ technology to provide safe water at nominal rates in India. Water ATMs are being currently experimented as a market-based solution on the idea of social entrepreneurship to provide safe drinking water to the urban poor in Delhi who are inadequately served by the public utility network. Based on a primary survey, the present case study aims to look at the challenges and opportunities these water ATMs pose. The study assesses its scope for further expansion as a solution to water security for urban poor residing in low income areas by analysing the issues of both supply side as well as demand side management of this technology. It is believed that water ATMs have tremendous potential to reduce waterborne diseases affecting the lives of millions of people in India and can minimize plastic waste and prevent plastic contamination as posed by the booming packaged water industries. Though water tariffs are nominal, water ATMs, for the first time are operating on the model of a paid community standpipe, in urban poor areas in India. So the big question remains whether the water ATMs can be seen as a complimentary source of safe water to the urban poor or it can be turned into an alternative option for universal coverage of piped network. © 2019, The Joint Center on Global Change and Earth System Science of the University of Maryland and Beijing Normal University.},

Using partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM), survey data from 128 sparkling wine firms are analysed. The results highlight the roles of carbon footprint and employment as drivers in the creation of shared values (SVs), considering the major export markets of Prosecco Superiore DOCG. This empirical evidence may be of interest to firms in the wine sector when considering, in their business decisions, the added commercial value that is derived for the adoption of environmental practices and sustainable social actions. Hence, following this logic, they can manage more inclusive and virtuous paths towards positive social entrepreneurship and an environmental externality to the community. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={This paper uses as its base a key initiative involving a not-for-profit organisation (NPO), government start-up funding and a social enterprise which evolved through three phases. The purpose of the initiative was the development of a smart phone technology platform for people with disability. The paper’s purpose is to answer questions about the ways in which the mobile technology, seen here as assistive technologies, supported the development of disability citizenship and active citizenship. Data were collected through in-depth interviews conducted at three points in the 13-week programme during which participants with disability received customised support for their phone and training in its use, at no cost. Fifteen participants volunteered to take part in the research project, along with their significant other and service provider. Key themes were identified in the preliminary analysis. Exploring these using Ragnedda’s ([2017]. The third digital divide: A Weberian approach to digital inequalities. Abingdon: Routledge) three levels of digital divide, and Wilson’s ([2006]. The information revolution and developing countries. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press) categories of access allowed a series of philosophical, ethical and human services management questions to emerge, challenging the optimism with which the digital economy is presented as a solution to issues of inequality. Although the mobile technologies were very successful as assistive technologies for some participants, the findings reinforced the potential for such technologies to further entrench aspects of social exclusion. They also identified ways in which the shift in the role of the NPO to social entrepreneurship, and its relationships with government and private enterprise, had the potential to undermine the exercise of disability citizenship by turning participants into consumers. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Social Entrepreneurship Organizations (SEOs) aim to solve social, environmental or societal problems even as they strive to work profitably. The achievement of the social mission also requires economic viability and differentiation from the competition. Acting in contested markets, SEOs must, therefore, adopt a competitive strategy to deliver services and products. While literature concerning achieving competitive advantages through a strategic concept has a long tradition in business management, little is known about how SEOs can use different strategic orientations (SO) to achieve superior performance. Based on a global sample of social entrepreneurs (n = 130), this study assessed the impact of market orientation (MO), entrepreneurial orientation (EO), and brand orientation (BO) on SEO performance. The findings indicate that MO and EO help SEOs to foster social and market performance. Using partial least squares (PLS) path modelling, in conjunction with fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA), this study also provides new insights into the interplay of SO, illustrating that MO and BO are complementary approaches that contribute to economic performance. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

abstract={The main difference between a social entrepreneurship and other business entities is the prevalence of a social over its business purpose, the restriction of the distribution of profits between its owners and the transparency of its activities. The peculiarities of the socio-economic development of the USA and the countries of Western Europe led to the formation of two concepts of social entrepreneurship. In the American concept, a social enterprise is seen as a business organization focused on solving social problems. In the European concept, social enterprises are the key result of social activity, and the business result is considered as an additional one. Analysis of data from special surveys and research of social enterprises in the world (in the absence of official statistical information) indicates the high rates of growth of the number of social enterprises and the number of employed workers in European countries, where they are actively supported by the state. For European social enterprises, they are characterized by a wide range of activities (but the service sector is a priority); various organizational and legal forms; the tendency to increase the share of own funds as a source of financing activities. © 2019, Allied Business Academies.

abstract={Entrepreneurial activities are sometimes framed as market-based strategies that compromise the integrity of the movement against the global agrifood system. Other times, scholars have argued that entrepreneurship is a critical component of local food system viability. This study helps reconcile these conflicting views through a qualitative exploration of the variations in the commercially and socially oriented features of local food entrepreneurship in the southeastern Arizona local food system. Researchers gathered data between August 2014 and December 2016 through semistructured interviews with and direct observations of 36 southeastern Arizona local food entrepreneurs. A conceptual continuum that articulates the variations between commercial and social entrepreneurship according to market condition, mission, resource mobilization, and performance measurement guides the exploration. The findings reveal commercial and social variations in local food entrepreneurship to be assorted, yet synergistic enactments of the economic, environmental, and social conditions and principles that characterize the southeastern Arizona local food system. The findings push the local food entrepreneurship narrative beyond the limitations of a rigid activist-market dichotomy by illuminating the synergistic complexities that influence the form and function of local food systems. The article discusses implications for both local food practitioners and scholars. © 2017 by the Rural Sociological Society},

abstract={Purpose: Little attention has been given specifically to the experience of women social entrepreneurs despite the assumption they are prone to “care”, and even less to their motivations or their self-perception of success. This paper aims to provide an insight into the relationship between motivations and social and economic performance among women social entrepreneurs in ten European Union countries. Design/methodology/approach: This paper classifies the motivations of women social entrepreneurs, drawing on the results of a survey conducted (n = 380) by the European Women’s Lobby. The paper then examines how these motivations relate to self-perceptions of social and economic performance. Findings: In addition to being driven by self-interest and prosocial motivations, women social entrepreneurs also seek to develop alternative business models. Where a social mission is central, women are likely to feel successful in meeting their social aim; however, there is a strong negative relationship between self-interested motivations and revenue. Research limitations/implications: This analysis relies on perceptual and self-reported data; therefore, more objective measures should be considered for further research, possibly combined with a longitudinal design. Another limitation of this paper lies in the non-random sampling strategy used to identify a hard-to-reach population such as women social entrepreneurs. Practical implications: The findings provide a better understanding of the motivations of women social entrepreneurs. This may be useful in assisting funding or support organisations, as well as social investors, evaluate where to best invest resources. In addition, a more nuanced understanding of motivations among women social entrepreneurs can inform policies aimed at supporting women social entrepreneurs, without necessarily being bound by the expectation to maximise economic and/or social outcomes. Originality/value: This paper demonstrates the centrality of the social mission for women social entrepreneurs. The results also identify “seeking an alternative business model” as a key motivation among women social entrepreneurs, thereby breaking existing conceptualisations of entrepreneurial motivations on a binary spectrum as either “self-interested” or “prosocial”. The paper also shows that having other than prosocial motivations for becoming a social entrepreneur does not necessarily lead to higher economic revenue. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to devise an experimental lab like infrastructure in the higher education connecting social innovation with sustainable tourism. Design/methodology/approach: In order to model a laboratory of social innovation and sustainable tourism lab (SISTOUR-LAB), the method of agile research was employed. This method involves the creation of successive and accumulative prototypes of four kinds: conceptual, relational, functional and transferable. Thus, agile research enables the integration of different social perspectives into the same prototype in a recursive manner. Findings: The SISTOUR-LAB is a work-based learning strategy that allows for the development of a mapping process on tourism vulnerabilities (linked to opportunities for social innovation); the development of experimental training in prototyping social innovations on sustainable tourism; the design of hybrid social innovation business models linked to sustainable tourism; and the development of a relational model of evaluation linking together social innovation competencies with processes of transition toward sustainable tourism. Research limitations/implications: The SISTOUR-LAB is a prototypical lab that combines social innovation and sustainable tourism in an experimental setting. The SISTOUR-LAB has been modeled based on the agile research method, but it will be necessary to test it empirically to stabilize the model. Once stabilized, the model shall lead to a better understanding of the relationship between work-based learning, social innovation and sustainable tourism in the area of higher education. Practical implications: The SISTOUR-LAB has four implications: teachers: the SISTOUR-LAB provides teachers with a setting for the development of experimental education models that connect the problems of conventional tourism with social innovation in order to foster new learning environments oriented toward sustainable tourism; students: the SISTOUR-LAB enhances the employability of students since it connects them with agents and demands of touristic transition, while also fostering entrepreneurial development by means of improving the acquisition of social entrepreneurship competences for sustainable tourism; organizations: the SISTOUR-LAB provides an experimental setting for the prototyping of social innovations so as to assist organizations in the formulation of models, prototypes and evaluations that facilitate the transition toward sustainable tourism; policymaking: the SISTOUR-LAB promotes the design of evidence-based public policies, which fosters inclusive models of innovation and the regional monitoring of transitions toward sustainable tourism. Originality/value: There exist little reference to the link between social innovation and sustainable tourism in the academic and institutional literature. The SISTOUR-LAB is a work-based learning strategy that fosters the structuring of experimental relations between social innovation and sustainable tourism by integrating touristic organizations to the development of competencies in higher education. The SISTOUR-LAB has programmatic and prospective value. It can be considered as a guide for the development of generative competencies, i.e. competencies that generate social innovations that impact chain triggers transitions toward sustainable tourism. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={With a history of civic associations turned political, and an ongoing sociopolitical transformation in Egypt, social entrepreneurship (SE) has proliferated as an alternative to traditional forms of civic engagement such as charities on one hand and open activism on the other. Yet, situated between a desire for change, and the overpowering state and market logics, SE has been both limited and shaped by neoliberal and local-authoritarian visions. Using Egypt as the case, this study combines in-depth interviews with civil society practitioners, and field observation at an SE incubator, to examine how SE came to embody a desire for change using publicly sanctioned logics, all while enacting practices that preserve/revitalize a social movement in abeyance. By examining SE as part of a larger phenomenon in this particular moment of transition, this timely research allows us to investigate a link between social movements and SE not as two separate phenomena but as different ways of approaching the same thing: creating social transformation. © 2017, International Society for Third-Sector Research and The Johns Hopkins University.},

abstract={Due to a massive increase in available social venture capital (SVC), social entrepreneurs often get to choose among various financing options. As financial parameters can easily be adapted or replicated, this article analyzes how social entrepreneurs evaluate the central nonfinancial features of these funders. Based on an experiment with 44 social entrepreneurs, we assess their perception of the five most relevant criteria for evaluating investor attractiveness: business advisory, network access, information rights, control rights, and reputation of the investor. Our analysis of 1,056 hypothetical decisions reveals that the investor’s reputation is the single most important criterion and that the positive effect of support provided through business advisory and network access strongly outweighs the negative effect of oversight via information rights and control rights. These findings indicate that social entrepreneurs perceive the behavior of SVC investors as steward like rather than principal like. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.},

One of the first scholarly attempts to build a research agenda to better understand the scaling of social impact was the SCALERS model. Building on initial theoretical and empirical work, this study is based on a sample of 179 nonprofit organizations in Italy. It also extends prior work by providing theoretical grounding through contingency theory and conducting the first empirical test of the situational contingencies of the SCALERS model. A positive relationship between each of the SCALERS variables and scaling—except replicating—has been found. Initial evidence of five contingencies that moderate the relationship between the SCALERS and scaling of social impact has also been found. © 2016, International Society for Third-Sector Research and The Johns Hopkins University.},

abstract={The social entrepreneurship discourse in Germany has become more prominent at a time when the deeply rooted corporatist traditions of social provision have come under pressure for marketization. This article examines the potential role of “social entrepreneurs” in the institutionally established German welfare state. The article analyzes the opportunities and constraints that new players face. Drawing on survey data and case studies in the areas of elderly care and advancement of children with immigrant background, the analysis retraces the structure and diffusion of social entrepreneurial projects. It concludes that the simple transfer of the social entrepreneurship model is unlikely. The analysis suggests that successful social ventures in Germany adapt the notion of social entrepreneurship to prevalent institutional realities. In the context of more encompassing social services, dense decentralized networks, and different cultures of philanthropism, new players have a complementary role that stimulates rather than dominates the process of social innovation. © 2016, International Society for Third-Sector Research and The Johns Hopkins University.},

The role of the social entrepreneur is described as fundamental in any social entrepreneurial venture. However, there are few natural-born social entrepreneurs and a lack of knowledge concerning the process of developing a social entrepreneurial venture. Recent studies question the all-important role of the social entrepreneur and instead recognize a collective process of innovation. This study developed a first attempt at a social entrepreneurial management tool which can reproduce the processual thinking of the social entrepreneur. In applying empirical data from social entrepreneurship case studies to a modified version of the analytical planning tool known as the Problem and Objective tree, this study addressed the lack of knowledge concerning the social entrepreneurial development process. The results suggest that the tool can assist social entrepreneurial networks, meaning a collective effort by stakeholders within any given community, develop social entrepreneurial ventures in environments without a ‘natural born’ social entrepreneur. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

We conducted a program evaluation of the first 9 years of the Global Social Entrepreneurship Competition (GSEC) at the University of Washington to assess the outcome of participation. Method: We sent an e-mail survey to all GSEC participant finalists from 2005 to 2013. Responses to closed-ended questions were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and responses to open-ended questions were analyzed for major themes. Results: Of the 111 finalist teams, 46% responded to the survey. Motivations for participating included prestige (77%), networking (62%), and mentoring (49%). Of respondents, 76.4% indicated their teams were interdisciplinary, having backgrounds in business (78%), engineering (39%), and health sciences (22%). Of the 19 teams awarded a prize, 12 subsequently launched their businesses. Most respondents (81.4%) felt GSEC helped them become better global social entrepreneurs. Conclusion: Evaluation results suggest that networking and mentoring are key benefits of participation, and that more could be done to increase health sciences students’ involvement. Further research is necessary to explore the global impact and social return on investment of these competitions. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.},

abstract={Social enterprise is a growing force in the Australian economy, with great potential for local job-creation and stimulating new entrepreneurship across the service, manufacturing and retail industries. However, the sector also has a ‘dark side’–whereby its social welfare agendas are sidelined in favour of profit-driven motives, the outsourcing of government services and perpetuation of inequalities between those that manage and those that benefit from the enterprises. In this light, it is perhaps not surprising that social enterprise literature has emerged predominantly from the field of business management, resulting in an over-representation of perspectives that privilege the economic, and technocratic, aspects of social entrepreneurship. This is particularly problematic in the context of the arts, which often challenge, transform and exceed conventional understandings of social value. This paper explores the potential role of art- and fashion-based social enterprises in contributing to sustainable community development while also activating positions of critique and political engagement from inside the mechanisms of contemporary capitalism. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={This article presents an exploratory study on the determinants of social entrepreneurial intention of women in deprived areas. A qualitative design is adopted to understand what conduce women to business creation. Six life stories of women met in the heart of the 'cité des Quatre-Mille', a deprived area next to Paris, in the city of La Courneuve are analysed. Those six entrepreneurs-to-be offer the opportunity to enrich the traditional push and pull factors of entrepreneurial intention. The economic dimension seems to be essential, as those women want to create their own job (push). According to the societal, territorial and social dimensions, it is more about a desire to improve their surroundings and to play a societal and territorial role (pull). It is therefore a challenge but above all a crystallisation of another way of considering entrepreneurship, which is seen as a way to change their everyday life and their immediate environment rather than to change the world. © Copyright 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={Performance of Indian microfinance institutions (MFIs) is crucial to ensure access to financial services by the poor who lack access to finance from banks. Improvement in technology of Indian MFIs over a period of time is vital to ensure higher access and expansion of microfinance services to a large number of poor individuals or households in the economy. Better performance of Indian MFIs is also important, as MFIs are social entrepreneurial in nature, expecting fair returns on their investment. This article analyzes the changing trends of technological change in Indian MFIs by using the technological index, decomposed from the Malmquist total factor productivity index (TFP), employing data envelopment analysis (DEA) for a panel of 34 Indian MFIs during the period 2005–2006 to 2010–2011. We further use a static panel data model, such as random effect model (REM), to examine various macro- economic determinants of technological change in Indian MFIs during the period 2006–2007 to 2010–2011. Our result indicates that the technological change in Indian MFIs is positively driven by macroeconomic factors, namely, GDP growth rate and size of the economy, whereas it is negatively influenced by the rate of inflation. © 2016, © 2016 International Management Institute, New Delhi.},

Narratives are an important part of the study of career-related transitions, as they form, revise, and reconstruct identities, and drive agency. For this purpose, 24 in-depth semi-structured narrative interviews were conducted with Israeli social entrepreneurs. The findings point out a process which takes place in different spheres and moulds the life story of a social entrepreneur: the personality sphere; the family sphere, including family dynamics and significant childhood experiences; the social sphere, including formative events outside the family; and the moral sphere, which includes attitudes and ideologies. The entirety of spheres generates a consistent meta-narrative which promotes a theoretical integration between psychoanalytical and existential psychological theories and offers a deeper understanding of how and why people become social entrepreneurs. © Australian Council for Educational Research 2016.},

abstract={The issue of narrowing the digital gap for disadvantaged people has been widely discussed. Yet, the study of how to enable low-income people and homeless wanderers to access computers and the Internet, thereby enabling their upward movement in society, has been relatively neglected. In this paper, the authors aim to meld the literature on digital divide and social entrepreneurship to propose a social entrepreneurial system which uses universal service funds to spread IT technologies, leading to greater entrepreneurship and the gradual alleviation of poverty among disadvantaged people. The theoretical model is followed by a case study of the Taiwanese government’s efforts to ameliorate digital divides. The case study is used to show the size of the access problem and identify factors which cause inefficiencies in the current approach to reduce the digital divide. After showing the need to establish a social entrepreneurial system to solve these problems and effectively use the Internet as a means to reduce poverty, the paper concludes by discussing the model’s contribution to and implications for the social entrepreneurship literature and digital divide literature. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Sustainability-oriented organizations have typically adopted governance approaches that undertake community participation and collaboration through multistakeholder arrangements. Documented challenges of this model are associated with collaboration and institutional capacity, and include reactive accountability structures, inability to reach consensus, funding limitations, and lack of innovation. Social entrepreneurship is a model used successfully in other social sectors; yet, it has rarely been explored by sustainability-oriented organizations. Nevertheless, research in other sectors has found that social entrepreneurship models of governance can encourage diverse participation from a wide range of social groups. In this paper we consider the value of social entrepreneurship for sustainability-oriented organizations by examining whether it can help address governance-related challenges associated with collaboration and institutional capacity. Analysis of organizational documents and participant interviews in three biosphere reserves in Atlantic Canada revealed that, over time, these organizations have struggled to maintain their mission objectives, retain productivity, and respond to economic stress. By examining social entrepreneurship theory and its practice in a biosphere reserve in northern Quebec, we learned that social entrepreneurship strategies more effectively target values and expertise, encourage meaningful engagement, foster strategic direction, and promote diversified and stable funding models than the stakeholder models explored. We determined there are opportunities to develop hybrid governance models that offer the benefits of social entrepreneurship while addressing the procedural concerns outlined by the stakeholder model. © 2016 by the author(s).},

Further, we find self-efficacy and goal setting theories to be particularly relevant in studying why PhVCs engage in value-adding activities. Concretely, PhVCs engage in value-adding activities that are in line with their efficacy beliefs and that facilitate the achievement of lower-order goals related to professionalization, self-sustainability, and expansion. As such, they aim at reaching the higher-end goal of scaling the social venture. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={While scholarly enquiries of social entrepreneurship (SE) and social innovation may be in their infancy, the practice of individuals, partnerships and community groups working together in innovative ways to identify and implement creative solutions to long-standing, complex social problems is not new. Growing research efforts to investigate the use of entrepreneurial activities for the pursuit of social gains is matched by increasing media and government interests in the capacity and potential for social entrepreneurs to identify innovative solutions, which address enduring social problems. A key driver of current government enthusiasm for social entrepreneurs, SE and social innovation are the increasingly liberal, arms-length ideologies underpinning recent policy platforms such as the Big Society in the UK and policy initiatives including Obama’s Social Innovation Fund, which is designed to find and help ‘scale’ the best social innovations in the US. Combined with the imperative to address considerable holes in public finances, political leaders the world over are keen to understand the potential for social entrepreneurs and social innovation to help the global economy recover from the fall-out of the worst financial crisis experienced since the Great Depression. This chapter critically considers growing research interest in activities and engagement in the entrepreneurial process for social and public rather than individual financial gains. Its overall contribution is the provision of a rigorous overview not only of the phenomenon of SE but also of the closely aligned topic of social innovation. © Elizabeth Chell and Mine Karataş-Özkan 2014.},

However, considering the multidimensional character of poverty, the findings are not suggestive of a panacea. Given the fact that the conscious abdication of personal financial gain by those who invest in a social business company is the defining attribute in Yunus' concept, the authors conclude that his idea is primarily a strong plea for social entrepreneurship. It is a strong call for the efficient use of philanthropic resources in contrast with a more conventional charity approach. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. All rights are reserved.},

abstract={Little is known about the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation (EO) and performance within not-for-profit (NFP) organizations. Through the development of a conceptual framework for understanding how EO may function within an NFP context, we propose three separate interaction effect models to examine organizational performance outcomes as measured in terms of high growth. Four conceptualizations of high growth are offered. Based on a theoretical consideration of social capital and financial accounting theory, we propose that NFP executives who possess a combination of EO and two other key factors, a social mission orientation and financial sustainability orientation, will be a strong predictor of high-growth organizational performance. The model thus builds upon previous research that explores the relationship between entrepreneurial behavior, market orientation and performance by distinguishing between market and non-market stakeholders and the need to balance between both when pursuing entrepreneurial opportunities. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.},

Market orientation is the key strategic orientation that assists for-profit organisations achieve improved performance and can potentially also assist charities that play a vital role within society but are facing increasing competition. Utilising a discourse transformation framework to case study a charity that introduced market orientation as its dominant strategic orientation, thematic analysis identifies how management transformed the organisation via a three-phase process and greatly improved performance. The new dominant market orientation was aided by elements of other strategic orientations, particularly entrepreneurialism. Minimal articles have previously examined how management of a charity can successfully implement a market orientation. The article also introduces a discourse transformation perspective into the examination of market orientation and offers charity managers valuable insights to assist performance improvement. © The Author(s) 2013.},

abstract={Several strategies and have been attempted in resolving the escalating crime problem in developing countries. The traditional 'Use of Force' approach has been found ineffective while the newer approach of improving 'Citizen's Security' is questioned as to its sustainability. This research uses a mixed methodology approach of regression analysis and focus group session, to examine the factors that impact the stakeholder's perception of police performance within developing countries. The police are considered to be a key stakeholder, yet is the least trusted. Data is retrieve from a Community Policing Survey amongst a total of 3000 adults island-wide (Jamaica), using a nationally representative sample. The results show that interaction with citizens, ability to control crime; trust, confidence and fear are significant in explaining the perception of police performance. These elements are also critical in bolstering and sustaining social inclusive partnerships and strategies. The discussion reveals that Social entrepreneurship and social enterprises is one of the most appropriate vehicles to build and deliver sustainable social inclusive strategies; while improving the perception of performance of all stakeholders, including the police. The paper contributes to the scholarship on Social Entrepreneurship and Community Safety and Security as these are interconnecting if the objective is to be achieved and sustained. It provides useful insights for the police force, policy makers, international funding agencies, NGOs and community groups and members.},

Some scholars attribute this to the lack common agreement of what social entrepreneurship is. Concurrently, the issue of the transformative service for improving well-being has been identified as one of the emerging areas of priorities service research. Despite the potential, such research has been under researched. This article thus aims to contribute to the knowledge by conceptualizing social entrepreneurship as a model of transformative service through the integrated theoretical lenses of innovation, entrepreneurship and service research. This conceptual paper maps social entrepreneurship and social innovation in a continuum of transformative service according to the types of change and the values they bring to the organizations and/or to the society.

abstract={In the struggle to remain true to their technical assistance and civic engagement missions in an era of shrinking budgets and increasingly complex accountability claims, land grant universities have developed different engagement strategies to contribute to the development of surrounding communities. Drawing on Flora and Flora's (in Ann Am Acad Polit Soc Sci, 48, 1993) assertion that a strong and "entrepreneurial" social infrastructure is critical for facilitating lasting change and development in communities (particularly rural communities), this article presents a case study of a land grant university's engagement with a community landcare group from the perspective of building social capacity in surrounding communities. This case explores Virginia Tech's involvement in facilitating and supporting Catawba Landcare using three theoretical frames-Ronald Heifetz's concept of "holding environments" as a safe and facilitated space where social learning can occur; ecological and social entrepreneurship and the roles and functions required to support these forms of entrepreneurship; and the concept of learning action networks in which otherwise disparate partners are linked under common goals and collectively learn how to manage the situation at hand. Using these three theoretical frames, this paper posits landcare as a model of engagement for land grant universities thus contributing to the construction of social infrastructure. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

affiliation={University of Melbourne, Australia},
abstract={In 2001, the inception of the Singapore-based gay web portal, Fridae, created a buzz in the local gay and lesbian community.1 Unlike the now delisted and then more ostentatious PlanetOut and Gay.Com which peaked alongside the dotcom bubble and queer commodity boom, Fridae sported a more subdued, and what some would hail, an understated design interface. With a logo and slogan on one end of the headbar championing the empowerment of 'gay Asia', and a series of polysexual animated stick figures on the other, the greyish blue tone of the homepage was minimalist and stylish. It had none of the hunky washboard stereotypes on display or the amateurish rainbow-lined graphics of other gay travel guides such as Utopia Asia. It was as if a front had surfaced to mark the arrival of the uniquely Singapore scene. Its almost reticent image seemed to embody the daily commonsensical expression of homosexuality in the country. Don't ask, don't tell, just be. Not quite the same mantra that bespeaks the West, this utterance refers to homosexuality's unofficial tolerance by the broader spectrums of the government and polity, resonating with the parlance, 'don't ask for gay rights, don't publicly announce your sexuality, and we will let you just be'. What started as just another gay website selling personal Prof.les, marketing the occasional lifestyle accessory and publishing the select news stories, Fridae quickly expanded to become a key player for regional gay advocacy. Between 2001 and 2004, it organised the country's first public circuit parties. Aptly named the Nation Party strategically scheduled on the country's national day, the annual protest party grew so big that it became not only a main event in the regional 'pink' calendar, it also raised the ire of the authoritarian State who quickly banned the party after more than 8000 revellers attended the last bash. It was too big and too public, the organisers were told. By this time, the local scene had caught the gaze of the global press. "Got Pink Dollars to Spend? Then Head for the Lion City. Singapore: It's In to be Out," Time Asia (Price, 2003) proclaimed. "Singapore Swing: The City's Gay Balancing Act," the Wall Street Journal (Prystay, 2007) exclaimed. Notwithstanding its short-lived public parties, Fridae diversified in the areas of the arts and public health. From 2005 to 2008, it was officially recognised as a supporter of the arts and received the highest commendation from the country's statutory arts organisation, the National Arts Council. By 2010, its online behavioural sex survey has become the world's largest and most multilingual, surpassing similar health reports in the UK and Australia. In the last decade, the rise of Fridae coincided with many concurrent forces. Its new media commerce grew alongside the country's development of the creative economy. It tapped into a burgeoning regional subcultural market that was also emerging with queer social movements in Thailand, Taiwan, Hong Kong and China. Its platform is also especially suited to the pervasive network computing milieus that presently characterise Asia's prosumer media cultures. Against these forces, this chapter critically considers Fridae as a social enterprise by examining it as a hybrid business company with a social mission focus. This framework departs from orthodox studies of online gay personal ads and websites that focus on the construction of sexual identities; it provides a more pertinent way to understand the emergence of a gay social movement and queer entrepreneurship in a country where homosexuality is still illegal. As Geoff Mulgan suggests, "social entrepreneurship is part of the much broader story of democratization: of how people have begun to take control over their own lives, over the economy, and over society. It is, in some respects ... inseparable from the rise of social movements" (2006: 94). By providing social services, coordinating self-help resources and cultivating a volunteer culture, social enterprises facilitate a "governing rationality that values self-enterprise and personal responsibility" (Ouellette and Hay, 2008: 481). This chapter argues that Fridae's combination of business and social mission resonates with Singapore's neoliberal agenda; it further suggests that such a template provides the opportunity for the company to be a sustainable LGBT organization, thus serving as a model for the future of queer organizations in contemporary neoliberal economies. While this chapter's positive account of an expanding queer social movement and LGBT scene may seem to depart from this volume's earlier chapters that are more focussed on homosexual repression and restrictions, such an apparent disjuncture is not divergent. This pull/push, in/out feature of the community is characteristic of illiberal pragmatism. As this volume, and in particular, the book's introduction has shown, illiberal pragmatism is shaped by an ambivalent logic of liberalism and non-liberalism. Such a milieu supports the concurrent practices of closetedness and emancipation, in both official and unofficial forms of everyday life. As a social enterprise, Fridae's organisational model attests to this mode of governance, where, on the one hand, homosexuality is illegal but tolerated, and on the other hand, promoted through the cultural liberalisation of the creative economy. © Hong Kong University Press 2012.

The paper suggests that the former is better differentiated by a designation of 'social cause venturing' as it elaborates a point of departure from the present literature. Through a detailed analysis of a social venturing case, the paper explores some of the tensions between social cause venturing and traditional entrepreneurship. It proposes 'sponsor motive' as the major discriminating construct and highlights other differences, such as performance assessment, between the two fields. The paper argues for social cause venturing as a distinct domain that is fundamentally different from entrepreneurship as we know it, and recommends a course correction of the theory building effort. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Background. There have been a number of interventions to date aimed at improving malaria diagnostic accuracy in sub-Saharan Africa. Yet, limited success is often reported for a number of reasons, especially in rural settings. This paper seeks to provide a framework for applied research aimed to improve malaria diagnosis using a combination of the established methods, participatory action research and social entrepreneurship. Methods. This case study introduces the idea of using the social entrepreneurship approach (SEA) to create innovative and sustainable applied health research outcomes. The following key elements define the SEA: (1) identifying a locally relevant research topic and plan, (2) recognizing the importance of international multi-disciplinary teams and the incorporation of local knowledge, (3) engaging in a process of continuous innovation, adaptation and learning, (4) remaining motivated and determined to achieve sustainable long-term research outcomes and, (5) sharing and transferring ownership of the project with the international and local partner. Evaluation. The SEA approach has a strong emphasis on innovation lead by local stakeholders. In this case, innovation resulted in a unique holistic research program aimed at understanding patient, laboratory and physician influences on accurate diagnosis of malaria. An evaluation of milestones for each SEA element revealed that the success of one element is intricately related to the success of other elements. Conclusions. The SEA will provide an additional framework for researchers and local stakeholders that promotes innovation and adaptability. This approach will facilitate the development of new ideas, strategies and approaches to understand how health issues, such as malaria, affect vulnerable communities. © 2010 Allen et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

However, such CSR and social entrepreneurship remain very separate from each other. Further, both fail to take into account the so called "hybrid" enterprises emerging.

abstract={Many countries are working on the realization of a new sort of public management, which is less governmental and more market oriented. As a consequence the role of health-care managers is changing. They are increasingly addressed as (social) entrepreneurs. This article is based on the results of a survey sent to Dutch health-care executives. The aim of the survey was to explore how the new discourse affects the practice of management. The results show that entrepreneurship is a construction and a contested concept. Nevertheless, executives are very sensitive to the concept. It certainly confuses them and can make them feel more vulnerable. However, new expectations can also perform an important function as a catalyst for executives to rethink their role and their position. From that point of view the phase of multi-interpretable expectations and vague discourse can be seen as a necessary phase in realizing health-care reform.},

The peri-urban geographies, though within a cosmopolitical city, lack basic amenities like drinking water, sanitation and waste management. We study social entrepreneurial strategies to address these issues and thereby illustrate strategies that could be used to address sustainable development goals. Design/methodology/approach: The article uses a multiple case study method to understand how social enterprises can provide scalable solutions addressing SDG related issues in India. Findings: The research found three strategies that can help provide scalable solutions: First, the extensive use of the latest digital technologies to decrease cost and increase reach; second, extensive partnerships across the board; and finally, a focus on social innovations and business models that are accessible, affordable, available and known to the end-users. Originality/value: The research contributes to institutional voids literature, SDGs literature and scaling of social enterprise literature. The research confirms that institutional voids are entrepreneurial opportunities. The research empirically shows how social enterprises are addressing SDGs at BoP.

abstract={Purpose: There is currently a wide range of methods for measuring social impact. Each method uses specific indicators, mainly because of the diverse characteristics of social enterprises (SEs) and the type of impact that is analysed, thus hindering the definition of a single, shared measurement system and, at the same time, prompting the proliferation of countless alternative methods. Many enterprises experience difficulties in selecting the best method to carry out the measurement process correctly. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to filling in conceptual gaps inherent to measuring impact and value creating in the domain of social entrepreneurship (SE), as well as equipping the social entrepreneur with better knowledge of the methodologies available for measuring impact and supporting their decision-making process. Design/methodology/approach: The aims of this paper are, therefore, threefold: to identify the common conditions of how to measure social impact (literature); to analyse how measurement is actually undertaken in practice (process); and to compare the four main methodologies, among the numerous ones, that have been developed to measure the impact generated by SEs so far (methods and comparison). The authors compared four of the most commonly used methodologies in the field of social impact measurement, analysing advantages, disadvantages and application fields. They evaluated whether a method can be considered preferable to others in each case. Findings: The paper demonstrated the high fragmentation that characterised the existing literature concerning the measurement of social impact and the wide range of methodologies used, thus leading to a great confusion in regard to the selection of the most appropriate methodology for the pursuit of one's own ends. This often discourages the undertaking of the measurement process. The analysis used in this paper leads us to conclude that the social return on investment method is more popular than the other three alternatives. Research limitations/implications: There are significant deficiencies in methodologies adopted, and researchers must use innovative, situated approaches that fit with the SE literature. The authors concluded that for the future, there is a need to do a SLR in a disciplined way. Further research is strongly recommended in this area, to provide more comparative studies of existing methods. It is hoped that enterprises can be directed towards using a limited range of formal methods that can capture the diversity of the various application cases, thus making it possible to compare different situations: a limited range of formal methods that can capture the diversity of the SEs considered and the impacts generated will be promoted. Practical implications: The authors also want to analyse how the SEs concretely realise the measurement of their impact that often do not use the formal methodologies presented in the literature but rather tools created by the ad hoc companies on the basis of their specific needs. Originality/value: This paper makes a theoretical contribution to the literature of the theory on social value within the SE field by having regard to how to measure social impact. It partially responds to Choi and Majumdar’s (2014) and Hlady-Rispal and Servantie’s (2016) calls for the development of a theory of measuring social value. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

We found that the social entrepreneur engaged in values-related work, purposively interpreting and enacting values-laden practices to bring about a quiet transformation within the community.

abstract={The paper examines how the market and social logics which are supposedly counter to each other, converge into one rather than being two distinctive sets of actions, in the actions of a renewable energy social enterprise in an emerging economy context. To provide a foundation, the research draws upon literature on renewable energy, social entrepreneurship, market orientation, and social value creation. A qualitative in-depth case study research design with inductive theory-building approach for grounded theory development was conducted with two socially and environmentally inclusive renewable energy social enterprises in rural India. This resulted in a novel framework on a converging process comprising of: (a) Involved Searching, (b) Dialogic Localizing, and (c) Engaged Implementing. First, there is ‘involved searching’, where insights are generated through involved interactions for searching problematized contextual realities. Then, there is ‘dialogic localizing’, where insights are shared and acted upon through dialogically inclusive and localized solving. Finally, there is ‘engaged implementing’, where solutions are implemented through honest convincing and engaging mutuality. The findings make a novel contribution towards: (a) Going beyond the duality perspective and revealing social entrepreneurship as a phenomenon where the social and the market converge as an articulated whole, (b) Advancing hybrid organizing as a converging action with trappings of social value creation and market orientation, and (c) Revealing the potential of renewable energy social enterprises in blending the social and the market while working towards a sustainable environment. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The occurrence and scientific investigation of the phenomenon of social entrepreneurship are rather new. The term is very popular among politicians and is reflected in a lot of the political demands and willingness that they express. However, a review of the literature about it shows that there is no common ground or frame, and the historical developments are different in different countries and economies. Based on a study of the literature, a two-phase survey following the 'Policy Delphi' approach was conducted in Germany in order to enlighten this frameless picture of social entrepreneurship. Our results indicate five dimensions that extend the core term: 'social', namely 'Societal-Visionary', 'Ecological', 'Societal-Entrepreneurial', 'Economic', and 'Innovative-Entrepreneurial'. The degree of intercorrelation among the five dimensions shows that four factors, namely 'Societal-Visionary', 'Societal-Entrepreneurial', 'Economic', and 'Innovative-Entrepreneurial', have low to medium-high correlations. The fifth factor, 'Ecological', has the weakest correlation with all other factors. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the issue of performance measurement of social enterprises with main particular focus on economic performance approach reflecting local aspect, since the local aspect plays a significant role in social entrepreneurship concept. Thus, comparison of two instruments that consider local aspects: local multiplier 3 (LM3) and Input-Output analysis is examined. Input-Output analysis is empirically used to calculate social enterprises’ impact on the Czech economy and to confirm the assumption to be more suitable instrument for economic performance measurement of social enterprises in comparison to local multiplier 3 method. Design/methodology/approach: The research adopted two-phase approach. At first a qualitative approach was used to compare the two selected instruments (LM3 and Input-Output analysis). Consequently, a quantitative research was applied to determine the impact of social enterprises’ activities on the economies of individual regions. The research was carried out on a sample of social enterprises (143 subjects) in the Czech Republic covering the year 2015. For this approach, Symmetric Input-Output tables and multipliers were calculated and revenue data from each observed social enterprise were used. Findings: The findings of the research indicate effects of social enterprises’ activities on the economy in individual regions of the Czech Republic. The results clearly show that the impact of social enterprises on the Czech economy is not negligible. Calculated impacts differ in sectors as well as in regions. Besides, of these findings, the assumption that the Input-Output analysis is more appropriate instrument for economic performance measurement of social enterprises, especially in situation of a larger sample of social enterprises in different regions, in comparison to LM3 method, was confirmed. Research limitations/implications: The limitations of this study is the dependence on the Symmetric Input-Output tables, which are usually published by local statistical offices and it takes some time to construct them. A more significant limitation and future research direction relates to the lack of generally accepted measurement framework in the sector of social enterprises and lack of the data, especially quantitative, in the Czech Republic. Practical implications: The findings of the research represent a significant contribution to the process chain of understanding the role of social enterprises in (local) economy. The lack of proven impact of social enterprises to economy is considered as important limit of this sector development, not only from the perspective of investors and donors but also from the perspective of policymakers and even social enterprises themselves. The Input-Output analysis can be applied for any region of any country and can contribute to reduce scepticism about economic performance of social enterprises, thus to support putting social and environmental goals of social enterprises into practice. Social implications: This research has been carried out on the so far largest identified sample of social enterprises in the Czech Republic and provides data for discourse among stakeholders about social enterprises’ impact; thus, it enables to understand their impact and make capable to enlarge their support network and development. Originality/value: This research is a pioneering attempt to provide data about economic impact of social enterprises using Input-Output analysis in the Czech Republic. No previous research identifies such a large sample of Czech social enterprises and collects quantitative data about them, as well as considers Input-Output analysis as an option instead of LM3 method. The effort of this research has been to react on a research gap in studies related to the impact of social enterprises (reflecting local aspect). This paper could be understood as beneficial not only from the perspective of the Czech Republic but also worldwide. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: The study aims to test the applicability of a variant of the model proposed by Hockerts (2017) for assessing the social entrepreneurial intention (SEI) of male and female students. It extends the model by incorporating the university's environment and support system (ESS) as an additional more distal construct. The university's ESS, coupled with the experience with social, cultural and environmental issues can affect SEI by influencing the more proximal precursors of empathy towards others, perceived self-efficacy, perceived community support and social, cultural and environmental responsibility. Design/methodology/approach: A structured non-disguised questionnaire was administered to students at a Canadian university. A sample of 485 usable responses was analysed by means of second-order structural equation modelling. Findings: The results provide confirmation that the proposed model is a multi-group invariant and appropriate for analysing the SEI of male and female students. They also show that the university's ESS helps predict SEI indirectly through the complete mediation of the more proximal antecedents. Research limitations/implications: The questionnaire is limited to universities with social innovation and entrepreneurship initiatives. Practical implications: Outcomes of the study can help universities assess the efficacy of their social innovation and entrepreneurship initiatives for instilling a social entrepreneurial mind-set in students. Consequently, universities will be better equipped to raise the perceptions of venture feasibility and desirability, thus increasing students' perceptions of opportunity. Originality/value: The study advances the social entrepreneurial knowledge of the university's effect on the precursors of SEI. © 2020, Carlos Bazan, Hannah Gaultois, Arifusalam Shaikh, Katie Gillespie, Sean Frederick, Ali Amjad, Simon Yap, Chantel Finn, James Rayner and Nafisa Belal.},

We perform an empirical multivariable analysis using 2015 Global Entrepreneurship Monitor data related to social entrepreneurship. The results show that both the variables that measure the values and skills to start a business and those related to the environment differentiate social from commercial entrepreneurs. In addition, our findings show how the development of the country plays a decisive moderating role, modifying the effect of the values and skills to be a social entrepreneur, the influence of gender, and even the relevance of entrepreneurs’ perception of their environment. © 2020, International Society for Third-Sector Research.},

abstract={To date, entrepreneurship research has rarely focused on cooperatives. Recent research has suggested there is a positive association between cooperatives and women's entrepreneurial activity based on the assumption that this model is especially suitable for women's expectations and is favourable to their economic entrepreneurial development. However, few studies have empirically tested these propositions. This research, which analysed data from 264 Spanish cooperatives, confirms these findings. A mixed-methods approach was used. In the first stage, a Delphi study was run with 11 cooperative entrepreneurship experts to ask what factors may be decisive for women preferring a cooperative model. In the second stage, the factors derived from the Delphi study were used in a survey targeting female cooperative associates. The findings confirmed that female cooperative owners perceived this business model to be aligned with their values and best fit their work and lifestyle. This research contributes to the existing social entrepreneurship literature by providing empirical evidence from the Spanish context that highlights the role of women in cooperatives. The findings also emphasize the need for responsive policies and programmes that promote the cooperative model since it promotes female employment and women's entrepreneurial activity even in periods of economic austerity. © 2020 by the authors.

The results show that commercial entrepreneurs and social entrepreneurs have similarities in character and the personality traits of social entrepreneurs only affect the social entrepreneurial intention through subjective norms. The findings indicate that the entrepreneurship programs should aim to build a sense of social responsibility and the ability to think creatively towards sustainable development.

abstract={Ecotourism and sustainable development are widely debated topics in tourism industry in this 21st century. However, there are no proper strategies for protecting the ecosystem in developing countries. In India, majority of the population live in rural areas and therefore the Government faces a lot of challenges in protecting the natural ecosystem. In order to develop a successful sustainable ecotourism destination, there should be adequate involvement of stakeholders and their incentives. Mangalajodi Ecotourism Trust is a community owned and managed ecotourism facility promoted by Royal Bank of Scotland Foundation India (RBSFI) in partnership with Indian Grameen Services (IGS) and local Government bodies. The project is based on the principles of community ownership and Ecotourism involvement of key stakeholders for destination development. This paper describes the participatory framework and descriptive case study which analyze the various key stakeholders to the development of the Mangalogdi ecotourism destination. The research methodology involved in-depth interviews with key decision makers and communities involved in the destination development. The findings show a destination development system model that represents the various stakeholders, including local communities, local organizational involvement, tourism enterprises and tourists, with roles to promote and sustain the destination. © 2020 Editura Universitatii din Oradea.

abstract={Purpose: Ingenuity can be viewed as the use of creativity to develop innovation within constraints. The authors investigate how entrepreneurial ingenuity is enhanced by self-imposed ethical constraints, by using a case study of sustainability-driven technology enterprises in an emerging economy. The authors find that self-imposed ethical constraints can enhance entrepreneurial ingenuity because they encourage entrepreneurs to solve more complex problems as a result of considering the impact of the business on a more diverse set of stakeholders. The aim of this study is to show that while additional resources are normally considered an advantage, a dearth of resources can be a source of competitive advantage leading to ingenuity. By self-imposing ethical constraints, founders increase engagement of stakeholders who shape the firm’s industry toward greater sustainability knowledge. Design/methodology/approach: The authors used semi-structured interviews which are typically the most important data source in the Gioia methodology because they provide both retrospective and present accounts by individuals experiencing the phenomenon of theoretical interest (Gioia et al., 2012). The authors focused on founders at each enterprise who had sufficient knowledge to speak comprehensively and authoritatively about their organizations. The goals of the semi-structured interview protocol were to focus on the research question, avoid the use of terminology that could lead interviewees in their answers and maintain flexibility to explore spontaneous themes during the interviews. Findings: The authors examined the influence of entrepreneurial ingenuity on the creation of knowledge in an organization's environment. They defined entrepreneurial ingenuity as a type of organizational ingenuity (Lampel et al., 2014a, 2014b) and by focusing on the role of ethical constraints, examined the conditions under which it is influenced. They emphasized that ethical constraints warrant consideration in the knowledge management process (Rechberg and Syed, 2013) because they can stimulate entrepreneurial ingenuity. The authors also investigated the relevance of ethical constraints for founders of social enterprises in Brazil, an emerging economy of growing interest to knowledge management scholars. Research limitations/implications: This study brings the following three main contributions. First, by incorporating the scope of social entrepreneurship, the research contributes to the perspective that both ethics and innovation can positively coexist within an organization while contributing to knowledge management creation and success (Borghini, 2005; Schumacher and Wasieleski, 2013). Second, the authors establish ethics as an important type of constraint that can spark ingenuity and help break through the constraints of bounded awareness for knowledge management (Kumar and Chakrabarti, 2012). Third, by highlighting the role of self-imposed ethical constraints, this study helps answer a recent call for research on “entrepreneurial actions that benefit others” (Shepherd, 2015, p. 490) addressing “What are the constraints that disable or obstruct an organization’s normal routines from alleviating human suffering?.It could be less about whether it is good or bad to ignore constraints and more about which constraints are ignored and which are abided by” (Shepherd, 2015, pp. 499, 501, emphasis added). Practical implications: In this study, the authors show that entrepreneurs facing ethical dilemmas experience a unique cycle of equilibration, essentially throwing customary norms of equilibrium into disequilibrium. Treating ethics as both a lever and a constraint allows a more unique set of problems to be solved through knowledge management and entrepreneurship, so solutions to these problems can themselves become new sustainability-driven businesses. Social implications: This study opens up several opportunities for future research. The authors conducted a study with five sustainability-driven enterprises from Brazil. New research may benefit from examining a larger number of organizations in other countries to investigate potential environmental differences that affect ingenuity and knowledge management. This study highlights the notion of ethical constraints as enabling mechanisms, and thus self-imposed ethical constraints merit a more systematic consideration as a key additional factor that may inspire disruptive innovation (Christensen, 2013), blue-ocean strategy (Kim and Mauborgne, 2004), as well as value-creation for stakeholders (Tantalo and Priem, 2016). Originality/value: Resources are critical to both knowledge management and entrepreneurial activity and have been examined from numerous perspectives (Alvarez & Busenitz, 2001; Barney, Wright, & Ketchen, 2001; Moustaghfir and Schiuma, 2013). Entrepreneurs following a creation strategy depend less on accumulating existing knowledge and resources before beginning, and more on forming new knowledge or relationships that do not yet exist. They do this through a process of entrepreneurial trial and error (Alvarez & Barney, 2007, 2010). From a knowledge management perspective, individual knowledge sharing through both experimentation and learning by doing provide consistently high levels of knowledge sharing (Burns, Acar and Datta, 2011). This research emphasizes that constraints, such as limited resources and self-imposed ethical standards, can be a source of advantage leading to ingenuity and knowledge creation. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This special issue draws on various developments related to the role of business incubators, academia and social enterprises towards achieving inclusive entrepreneurship, innovation and sustainable growth. A ‘successful entrepreneurship ecosystem’, which includes business incubation is fundamental for promoting economic growth. Over the years, business incubators are increasingly viewed as the facilitators of social inclusion and inclusive growth. Likewise, there has been an increasing focus on how society at large can gain benefit from the research activities of the academia and also how it can promote social and student entrepreneurship. Because of the positive contributions of the social enterprise sector in terms of gross domestic product (GDP), employment and positive social and environmental impacts, social entrepreneurship has gained recognition as a mainstream activity across the world. Consequently, many Asian countries have initiated a range of policies to support social entrepreneurship because of their perceived contributions towards inclusive growth. © 2019 SAGE Publications.},

The reason why people have a stronger or weaker social orientation has been analyzed through the lens of different subjects, among biological, social, and behavioral sciences. However, the literature does not agree about which variables influence individuals to have more or less social orientation. We investigated which variables influence the entrepreneur's social orientation by using a large sample of individuals (n = 176,460) in 59 countries. Our results show that an entrepreneur's social orientation is stronger for women, more educated, and older people. The economic development of the country moderates these relationships among the social orientation, gender, and education level of the individual. We found that the individual's social orientation increases at the same rate as the country's development level. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Nowadays social entrepreneurship is recognized as a two-way process, addressing both social and economic concerns that can bring social inclusion, equity, and development to disadvantaged groups in society. This aspect is particularly important and desirable within emerging economies. In these markets, which are constantly faced with profound economic and social challenges, we see the growing importance of social entrepreneurs as they take upon themselves the provision of welfare services and progressive activities. However, our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the creation of social and economic values in social enterprises, and the factors contributing to the establishment of these value creation objectives, is still rather fragmented. Our article contributes to this gap in the literature by decoding the process via which for-profit social entrepreneurs from China and India create social and economic value. In addition, by combining a deductive and an inductive approach of analysis, we offer novel insights into the context-dependent processual patterns deciphered within the two countries. A new entrepreneurial process framework that reflects the contextualized social value creation process by social entrepreneurs is thus provided. © 2019 The International Association for Chinese Management Research.},

The study has been conducted through the positivism philosophy, and with the quantitative method, a survey was conducted based on the questionnaire consisted of the items related to understudied variables. Through purposive sampling, the data were collected from 231 students studying bachelors and masters at University of Beijing and Shanghai. SPSS software was used for screening and descriptive analysis, and AMOS was used for structure modeling and confirmatory factor analysis. Results showed that prior experience tends to have greater social entrepreneurial intent, empathy, self-efficacy, and moral obligation that have positive and significant impact on entrepreneurial intent. On the other hand, perceived social support puts negative impact on entrepreneurial intention. Business schools and policymakers can take advantage of this study.

However, it also has been increasingly used for nefarious purposes in recent years through misinformation campaigns, profiling, election meddling, and anti-vaccine propaganda. Researchers in social network analysis have provided a set of concepts and metrics to systematically study these dynamic processes. Innovators in information visualization have also contributed to helping users to discover patterns, trends, clusters, gaps, and outliers, even in complex social networks.

The objective of this paper is not to state a novel definition, this means not to “push out” but rather to “pull in” together to better understand what the scholars are talking about through their own social entrepreneurship (SE) definitions. In doing so, we contribute to the literature by synthesizing and analysing the SE definitions to better understand the field. To do so, a combination of methods was used: systematic review to reach the articles proposing definitions and memetic analysis to understand the content of the definitions by analysing their memes. From the analysis, three main categories were considered: entity types, entrepreneurial opportunities and intentions/promises.

abstract={Effective altruism is a conceptual approach and emerging social movement that uses data-driven reasoning to channel social economy resources toward philanthropic activities. Priority cause areas for effective altruists include global poverty, existential risks to humanity, and animal welfare. Indeed, a significant subset of the movement argues that animal factory farming, in particular, is a problem of great scope, one that is overly neglected and offers the potential for massive reductions in global suffering. This paper explores the philosophical and methodological tenets of these “effective animal advocates,” offering empirical qualitative insight into their motivations and perspectives. The work also considers the implications of the effective altruists’ entrance into the arena of animal advocacy, taking note of how various factions within both the effective altruist and animal protection movements have received their conceptual and practical interventions. The research highlights several potential contributions of the effective animal advocates, as their commitment to evaluate and amplify pragmatic solutions to the problems of animal suffering has the opportunity to shift institutional and consumer behaviors in ways the animal protection movement has struggled to do in the past. At the same time, key issues related to the community’s research rigor and measurability biases, its lack of demographic diversity, and its tendency to valorize corporate-driven technological solutions open it up to criticism from internal and external detractors alike. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={Purpose: Building on the resource-based view of the firm the purpose of this paper is to study the intangible resources available for social ventures, and presents a typology of growth strategies based on the intangible resources possessed by those enterprises. Design/methodology/approach: This research applies a multiple case study technique for ten social enterprises in Egypt listed on Ashoka and Schwab Foundation websites. The research employs a purposive sampling technique. Data triangulation is used based on reports, websites, and interviews with social entrepreneurs and employees. Findings: The study has three main findings: describing the intangible resources needed by social ventures to grow; detailing the growth strategies adopted by social ventures and corresponding funding mechanisms; explaining how intangible resources affect the selection of growth strategies, and how these interact with the context to produce expected outcomes. Overall, a typology for growth strategies of social ventures is presented. Research limitations/implications: This paper is an original attempt to advance research on social enterprises in relation to the RBV and the domain of venture growth and impact scale-up. Practical implications: This research is beneficial for social ventures and venture philanthropists who wish to learn about the specific resources important for venture growth, and understand the suitable strategies and context for organizational growth and impact scale-up. Originality/value: This research is one of the few attempts to study and explain the types of intangible resources in social ventures and the role of different resource bundles in deciding social venture growth strategy. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Background: Community Nurse Supporting Elderly iN a changing SOciety is a project funded by the European Union, which is aimed at developing an innovative care model based on community nurses to support active ageing in mountain areas. The planned sustainability of this innovative approach relies on social entrepreneurship, and this work highlights the necessary conditions for the existence of these entrepreneurial initiatives on the market, with community nurses' services purchased by the public health care system. Methods: The authors propose a sustainability framework for this project based on three relevant dimensions (ie, health, organisation, and context), highlighting the necessary conditions for continued provision of health services beyond project conclusion. Then, considering the Piedmont Region and those aged 65 or older as target population, health outcomes are analysed, proposing a break-even analysis to calculate expected levels. Results: According to our results, in order to care for 191 977 elderly people for 3 years, a successful pro-active approach is needed to prevent 1657 falls with hip fracture, reducing the prevalence of this adverse outcome by 36%. These are the expected health outcome levels for the existence of a social market, which can be achieved through the successful involvement of local public health organisations and stakeholders. Conclusions: Policy makers need clear information on the economic impact of extending this new intervention to the whole target population and on the required preconditions for its financial sustainability in terms of health outcomes. However, a participatory process involving all relevant local stakeholders and organisations is crucial to extend current achievements beyond project conclusion. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Purpose: This paper aims to critically examine the concept of social enterprises in Palestine. It uses the lens of institutional theory to understand how the political and economic context of the society can influence certain types of entrepreneurial behaviors and be responsible for the emergence of social enterprises. The paper uses a critical perspective to deconstruct social enterprises in Palestine to shed light on reasons for their emergence, motives and agendas. Design/methodology/approach: A case study design was used to examine the phenomenon of social enterprises. The case study method is valuable in describing the how and why issues of a phenomenon in the present time frame. Two leading social enterprises operating within the Palestinian region were identified. The two enterprises were contacted for a series of interviews (over a period of few months) with their owners and other active members. Findings: The empirical findings suggest that social enterprise model is still in its embryonic stages in Palestine. Their social mission of community development and sustainability is not completely sincere. The social entrepreneurs were willing to compromise social mission for economic surplus. The national structure, political framework, legal environment, social, cultural and the economic conditions of Palestine have served as suitable launching pads for social enterprises with not so authentic mission of serving the society. It has encouraged entrepreneurial philosophy and behavior, which has masked hidden economic and political agendas with exterior goals of social welfare and community development. Research limitations/implications: This paper adopts a critical perspective and a qualitative methodology, and this raises the concern if the arguments pertaining to social enterprise raised in this paper can sustain in a developed nation with a stabilized political scenario or whether this alternative ideology is only relevant to underdeveloped countries with unstable, political conditions, such as Palestine. Practical implications: This paper provides relevant information for students, critical academics and policymakers. Social implications: The paper argues for a more concise definition for the model of social enterprises. It argues for clear legal guidelines which could monitor the formation of social enterprises in Palestine. Originality/value: This paper provides an alternative perspective on social enterprises within a constrained and political unstable economy of Palestine. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Socio-tech ventures–entrepreneurial firms that aim to create social value by employing technological innovation as part of their key value proposition–are a rapidly growing category of organizations. They occupy a place of intersection between technology ventures and social enterprises and present an important and emerging area of research. Socio-tech ventures face the challenge of balancing social and market strategic orientations similar to social enterprises. However, their simultaneous status as technology ventures is likely to further complicate this balancing act and remains an unexplored dynamic in the extant literature. Strategic orientation is an important consideration since it impacts the activities and resource allocations of a venture that can influence its performance. Drawing from the technology innovation and technological and social entrepreneurship literature, this paper addresses this gap by developing a conceptual model and propositions, with examples from the global health sector, about factors related to the technology adoption process that can influence the social-market strategic orientation balance of socio-tech ventures. This model considers the influence of the tenure and innovation stance of venture founders/managers, the complexity and trialability of the technological innovation, the legal structure of the venture, and interconnectedness within the social networks. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Using the case of Burmese refugees in South Korea, this study reveals how the convergence of democratization in the homeland and the attainment of legal refugee status prompted former political exiles to establish socially responsible businesses for furthering their activism. By shining new light on the emergence of such social entrepreneurship amongst former political exiles, this study seeks to overcome two tendencies in refugee studies, namely to relegate the establishment of a business to a livelihood pursuit, dealing with business largely from an economic standpoint; and to approach activism only from the perspective of direct political engagement. This study integrates these two separate threads and brings the discussion of social entrepreneurship into refugee studies, demonstrating that some businesses established by refugees should be understood as a form of activism. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the transnational aspects of social entrepreneurship has accelerated inter-Asian connections. © The Author(s) 2018. Published by Oxford University Press.

The adaptation, known as I-Corps for Social Impact (I-Corps SI), extends the for-profit canonical model to include mixed revenue and non-profit business models, to help researchers generate social impact.

Findings: The paper describes limitations of the I-Corps model and modifications required to enhance social impact. Practical implications: While the field of social entrepreneurship has grown rapidly over the past few decades, social scientists have lagged behind in translating evidence-based research into solutions that can be scaled and sustained to achieve social impact. The paper presents an evidence-based case for a pedagogical tool to close this gap.

abstract={Purpose: This paper critically assesses Western views on the social economy in contrast to everyday realities in a low-income country, and challenges ethnocentric epistemologies in the discourse of social enterprise and social entrepreneurship that is prevalent in international development. It charts the changing trajectory of the social economy and different influences. Design/methodology/approach: Qualitative data is used to explore views of members of social enterprises in Northern Cambodia. Three enterprises with different characteristics were selected. Semi-structured interviews and a group discussion took place in each case, exploring motivation, values, empowerment, participation, equity, innovation and risk appetite. Findings: The important roles social enterprises play in rural community development are sometimes at odds with the reasoning of Western development agencies. The social economy in Cambodia is undergoing change with the advancement of capitalist market forces. This suits formal businesses but could exacerbate the exclusion of various community actors. Research limitations/implications: Three case studies are in close proximity in Northern Cambodia, and the situated dynamics may not transfer well to other contexts. Some limitations are offset by the selection of different types of social enterprises. Practical implications: The study gives insights of value to the designers of programmes or projects to support social enterprise who work within international development agencies and non-government organisations. For academics, it offers critical insight into assumptions about social enterprise that emanate from Western management literature. Originality/value: This paper meets the need for close-up inter-disciplinary work on social enterprise development in under-represented contexts. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Haiti's catastrophic earthquake of 2010 left approximately 200,000 people dead, 1.5 million homeless and most government buildings destroyed. Even pre-disaster, Haiti's outcomes on the UN Human Development Index were among the lowest in the world, and since the quake the country has fallen into further decline. Today, most Haitians continue to lack basic services, struggle with daily survival, and confront daunting challenges in their change efforts. Many have called for reconstruction of society, and argue that local civil society organizations should lead the way in these efforts by valuing local knowledge, and building on small-scale community successes. This research investigates one community's change efforts toward a new form of community development and potential pathway to transformation in Haiti. We aim to apply learning from this case to inform development practice and policy in Haiti and similar contexts. The case study community, Bellevue-La-Montagne, is applying an education-centered community development approach which has placed construction of a new school and education at the heart of collaborative rebuilding efforts by local residents and organizations, primarily Haiti Partners. Education and participatory practices are embedded in all aspects of the community development, including: social entrepreneurship, healthcare, environmental stewardship, community agriculture, planning and construction. These efforts involve participation of people and organizations (local and international) in dialogical negotiations that aim to share power and build capabilities of local people, and to create, change, or preserve structures and institutions consistent with the interests of local people. Participatory and phronesis research methodologies reveal nuanced understandings of the community development and its meaning for local people. In spite of substantial progress in development projects, findings reveal tension points that potentially threaten long-term sustainability, such as: the highly fragile nature of state-society relations, lack of a sense of agency of local people despite strong levels of participation, and differences between outcomes for the community as a whole and individual households. Moving from revealed community change in this case to a broader and deeper social transformation will require key ‘levers of transformation’ identified in this case as: 1) education; 2) place identity, networks, and research; 3) social entrepreneurship and social innovation; and 4) state-society trust and accountability. These levers can be activated through participatory and education-centered community development strategies that provide important roles for local people and civil society, and a nuanced role for international organizations which is sensitive to power dynamics. Such development strategies would give ‘voice’ to communities in their struggles for change. Strengthening, networking and scaling community level innovation that shows promise of transformation, such as the case of Bellevue-La-Montagne, would contribute to Haiti's attempts to forge a new narrative, and to evolving international development planning policy and practice. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

The rapid adoption of this high-value program, which is voluntary and runs counter to the dominant culture in US hospitals, was catalyzed by tens of millions of dollars in philanthropic support for innovation, dissemination, and professionalization in the palliative care field. We describe the dissemination strategies of the Center to Advance Palliative Care in the context of the principles of social entrepreneurship, and we provide an in-depth look at its hallmark training initiative, Palliative Care Leadership Centers.

Going beyond business and social entrepreneurship, which add value to economic and social spheres, respectively, biosphere entrepreneurship adds value to the biosphere. The purpose of this article is to define biosphere entrepreneurship, and to devise and extend mental models (frameworks) relating entrepreneurship and climate change in order to facilitate theory building. Using images and visual depictions, the article elaborates a series of illustrative candidate frameworks that suggest a theoretical model of biosphere entrepreneurship. The article aims to show how the Earth, humanity, and the economy are connected through negative and positive entrepreneurship. It extends extant frameworks from the fields of financial and capital, entrepreneurial allocation, risk and survival, value and disvalue creation, growth and de-growth, socio-cultural frameworks, and entrepreneurial opportunity in order to substantiate the existence of entrepreneurial activity that adds value to Earth.

abstract={Purpose: This paper aims to explore the way in which three indigenous social enterprises from Guatemala, Mexico and Peru, solve the paradox of simultaneously producing social and economic value, which creates organizational tensions. Design/methodology: This research follows a qualitative method based on a case study research strategy. Three different data collection techniques are applied: Analysis of internal reports, direct observation, and semi-structured interviews with relevant stakeholder, mainly employees and managers. Findings: Indigenous social enterprises deal with organizational tensions by adopting different organizational structures and privileging one dimension over the other (social or economic) in decision making Social implications: Indigenous social enterprises generate quality of life and reduce historical exclusion patterns by strengthening local economy dynamics through social innovation. Originality/value: Social innovations, appreciated in different organizational structures, contribute to alleviate the tension that arises from managing entities with double purpose. Also, this research provides evidence of how marginalized groups can overcome exclusion and poverty conditions by creating indigenous social enterprises. © 2018, OmniaScience.},

abstract={INTRODUCTION: Challenges facing the primary health-care sector mean that policymakers and clinicians need to think and act differently to move forward. The principles of social entrepreneurship have been implemented successfully for improved health outcomes in other developed nations. There is a knowledge gap around whether nurse practitioners (NPs) in New Zealand primary health care (PHC) align with these principles. AIM: To explore whether and how the innovative activities of primary care NPs can be described as socially entrepreneurial. METHODS: A descriptive qualitative approach was used with data collected using semi-structured interviews with NPs working in primary care (n = 7). Data were analysed using general inductive thematic analysis techniques. RESULTS: Nurse practitioners interviewed worked in government-subsidised private general practice businesses. Two main themes emerged: (1) the nursing model of care aligned with social entrepreneurship; and (2) building social capital. NPs described a desire to see health care delivered differently and this aligned with acting as a social entrepreneur. Social capital emerged through the requirement to establish significant collaborative relationships. DISCUSSION: It was found that NPs' work can be described as socially entrepreneurial. The holistic, person and community-centred model of NP care has an ultimate mission of improved health outcomes. Social capital is built through collaborative relationships with other health-care providers, individual service users and the community. However, the juxtaposition of the business model in primary care prevents NPs from initiating and leading sustainable change. © CSIRO.},

To what degree do social enterprise programs reflect what the literature deems to be important aspects of social enterprise values and outcomes? And finally, what curricula should exist to enhance these values and outcomes? Methods include analysis of program descriptions, courses offered, and course syllabi of social entrepreneurship and enterprise programs. We find that the programs reviewed reflect largely performative and managerialist values and have little focus on social aspects of social enterprise, such as building social capital, community organizing, or political engagement. We conclude by suggesting changes to curricula that highlight aspects important to social enterprise values, outcomes, and democratic governance. © 2017, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Purpose: This paper supports the call for using a separate research stream for long-term recovery vs disaster relief in humanitarian studies. The purpose of this paper is to highlight the thematic shift towards service operations during this developmental phase and explores the role of social entrepreneurial organizations. It builds from the literature on service operations management and social entrepreneurship to promote theory in humanitarian operations management. Design/methodology/approach: This exploratory study uses literature concepts and field data from multiple development case studies of social entrepreneurial organizations and social enterprises in Africa and the Middle East to analyze service operations. Findings: Clear contributions to the role of social entrepreneurship in providing humanitarian and development services were identified and categorized according to service operations management stages. Practical implications: This paper has important practical implications. The positioning of social entrepreneurial organizations as humanitarian service providers would open opportunities for new collaborations between donors and social organizations. Mainstream NGOs dominate the scene of servicing local communities; leaving aside social entrepreneurial organizations with substantial room for innovation that they might bring to the sector. In addition, social entrepreneurial organizations’ ability to build business models and design sustainability and scalability aspects for their operations may bring long-term development to impoverished communities. Global NGOs as well as government actors who carry out the first three stages of humanitarian operations could plan on working with (or even help creating) social entrepreneurial organizations to help with long-term recovery. Originality/value: This study examines the implications of two bodies of literature; service operations management and social entrepreneurship on humanitarian operations management research. It concludes with a conceptual framework emphasizing the contributions of social entrepreneurship in planning, development, delivery, and distribution of services in the long-term recovery humanitarian and development operations. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The CEO, Dr Satish Hande, focused on developing need-based customized solar energy products for off-grid customers. During the initial years, the company faced financial problems to meet its operational needs, which was eventually overcome. Solar Electric Lighting Company came up with several innovative products that increased productivity of customers. Though the products sold were priced low, care was taken to ensure that product quality was not compromised. The company subsequently faced several challenges. The appointment of dealers in lieu of its own branches did not deliver desired results. Increase in input costs landed SELCO in losses. Pressure from investors for profits when the company was facing financial crisis was the toughest of them all. Having overcome the obstacles, SELCO became profitable, expanded operations in six states of India and installed 200,000 solar lighting systems in a period of two decades. Several growth options presented themselves to Dr Hande. The most prominent being the need to make a choice of staying focused on customized products for the poor or cater to the upmarket, high-growth and profitable segment. © 2016, © 2016 SAGE Publications.},

Research questions: How do pitchers acquire frames for pitches? How do pitchers apply frames to existing pitches? How do pitchers gauge the fit between the innovation, frames, and stakeholders? Literature review: The literature examined - framing professional communication, developing pitches, and framing pitches - stresses the relationship between framing, agency, and deliberation. However, few studies approach data from the perspective of the pitcher and few frames outside of the problem-solution frame are considered. Methodology: This autoethnography analyzes data from more than 500 pages of field notes, 60 minutes of video-recorded pitch sessions, 25 interviews with pitch stakeholders, and various textual artifacts that pertained to Author 1's nonprofit startup organization, Hacker Gals. Themes in the data were identified and analyzed through the composition of analytic memos. Frames were identified and analyzed through close reading and holistic interpretation. Results and conclusions: The entrepreneur acquired the most influential frames through stakeholder discussion, applied these frames in a way that stacked and made salient multiple frames beyond the problem-solution frame, and judged frame fit by considering the degree to which catchers took up the frames. The study's results suggest that the practice of frame stacking might increase pitch effectiveness by mitigating troubled identifications. © 1988-2012 IEEE.},

The present theoretical framework uses social cognition theory to examine the link between dimensions of the social mission and the venture's appeal to resource providers, and suggests that the magnitude of social value created is only one of a broader set of mission characteristics that influence social venture outcomes, such as resource acquisition from potential resource providers.

abstract={Purpose – This paper provides a reflection about the usefulness of the concept of social entrepreneurship to Portuguese third sector organizations (TSOs) with the purpose of understanding the paths undertaken by the latter. Departing from a theoretical synthesis inspired by different approaches to social entrepreneurship, the purpose of this paper is to offer an operative view of the concept in light of the problematics of social innovation and organizational innovation. Design/methodology/approach – The empirical analysis focuses on the intervention models and management models of these organizations. It uses a sequential methodological approach that combines extensive and intensive analyses. Findings – The author has concluded that Portuguese TSOs show a fragile form of social entrepreneurship. This includes, among others, state dependency both in terms of models of financial management and the definition and regulation of activities, recipients and social intervention. This leads the author to claim, even though cautiously, that management models influence intervention models. Originality/value – The originality of this paper lies on the use of an analytic framework that offers an eclectic approach to social entrepreneurship. This approach goes beyond some hidden contradictions between Anglo-Saxon schools of thought, namely, the earned income school of thought, and the school of social innovation, as well as the European perspective on social enterprises, and the Latin-American school of solidarity economy. These schools have been reconciled for the purposes of this analysis, which attempts to operationalize the notion of social entrepreneurship in the Portuguese TSOs. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

It owes its origins to rising frustrations with conventional aid and traditional philanthropic giving and is seen as development assistance enabling resources to flow directly from the tourism industry into community development and conservation initiatives. Philanthropists have long sought to achieve social transformation, and travel philanthropy in all its forms has evolved through the democratization of charity, as a kind of “doing good” through “giving back” whilst travelling. This paper evaluates values, practices and impacts of traditional, modern and post-modern philanthropy. Drawing upon evidence emerging from a longitudinal study, which involved the retrospective evaluation of personal diary entries, participant observations and semi-structured interviews about the transcontinental Plymouth–Banjul (car) Challenge (PBC), it exemplifies how an initiative can evolve across all three philanthropic approaches. It further debates critical understandings of the problematic travel philanthropy concept and its role in stimulating sustainable development in sub-Saharan Africa. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine the contribution of corporate architecture to social value creation. It especially analyses the social effects of investments in experiential corporate architecture that have been carried out by Italian industrial companies. Design/methodology/approach – This study follows a qualitative approach. It is based on a survey and semi-structured in-depth interviews undertaken with six Italian industrial companies. The dimensions of the social-entrepreneurship model (innovativeness, proactiveness, risk management) proposed by Weerawardena and Sullivan Mort were chosen as a framework to investigate the social effects of investments in corporate architecture. Findings – The social effects of the innovativeness dimension are the integration of the company with the territory and development of sustainability. Proactiveness is related to improving the employees’ wellbeing in the workplace and the community’s quality of life. Risk management ensures the development of the local economic-social fabric. Research limitations/implications – This study combines social entrepreneurship and corporate architecture by highlighting the social effects of corporate architecture. Further, it proposes the structural embeddedness of the company in the territory of reference, a sense for beauty, and a sense of gift giving as further entrepreneurial traits that are generally not proposed in the social entrepreneurship literature. Practical/implications – The results of this study suggest that top management should consider: that investments in corporate architecture are a deliberate strategy of the company; that profits are not a purpose in and of themselves, but rather a means to achieve the social mission’s objectives; and the relationship with architects in terms of mutual involvement in order to understand corporate and local needs and effectively transform them into appropriate architectural solutions. Social/implications – Corporate architecture can help to solve a number of social problems, such as improving the community’s quality of life, providing employments opportunities, allowing the community to benefit from places of socialisation and aggregation, and offering facilities and services that support culture and encourage cultural exchange. Given that the social benefits are reciprocal, all stakeholders should financially support companies that invest in corporate architecture. Originality/value – To the knowledge, this is the first study to connect social entrepreneurship and corporate architecture. This research brings to light some Italian industrial companies that are investing in corporate architecture to create social value in the twenty-first century, after the pioneering investments of the Olivetti company. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={This article engages the question—what is the right business-society relationship? We consider three perspectives that seek to address the relationship: corporate social responsibility (CSR), social entrepreneurship (SE), and conscious capitalism (CC). We take a macroapproach considering how commentary about these approaches establishes a direction for corporate practice and its relationship to key stakeholder groups. We argue that these perspectives are ‘D'iscourses that provide arguments for and articulations about the direction of corporate practice and the business-society relationship. To organize our review of each perspective, and focus our critique, for each we highlight (a) drivers and influencers, (b) core assumptions and defining features, and (c) approaches and exemplars. Although distinct, all emphasize effective business practices as key to meeting social needs. CSR suggests legitimizing business practice; SE relocates business practices; and CC seeks to reimagine/rehabilitate business for social good. Ultimately, we conclude that these Discourses lack a clear communicative focus in terms of decision making within these organizations. We attend to this and other implications, and offer avenues for further research. © 2016 Center for Business Ethics at Bentley University.},

abstract={The purpose of this study was to examine the association between social entrepreneurship education and experience in prosocial behaviour on the one hand and the perceived desirability and feasibility of social entrepreneurship among business students on the other. A sample consisting of business students was selected bearing in mind the possible implications of this study on business education curricula. The sample included 512 soon-to-graduate business students from five countries: Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Slovenia and The Former Yugoslav Republic (FYR) of Macedonia. Our results indicate a statistically significant positive association between the “know what” component of social entrepreneurship education and both the desirability and the feasibility of social entrepreneurship. The “know how” component of social entrepreneurship education is statistically significantly positively associated with the feasibility of social entrepreneurship. Experience in prosocial behaviour has a statistically significant positive association with both the desirability and the feasibility of social entrepreneurship. Our results suggest that social entrepreneurship education programmes should include gaining some experience in volunteering, activism and making donations. These activities focus students’ attention on social problems and empower them to find proper solutions. © 2016, FACTEACHEREDUCATION. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The purpose of this paper is to uncover the challenges faced by Philippine for-profit social enterprises as they pursue both financial and social objectives, and to determine the strategies they utilize to achieve these dual bottom-lines. Our research builds on Dees and Anderson's work (2002) that proposed a set of strategies to address the challenges faced by for-profit social ventures. Utilizing multiple case study research design as proposed by Yin (2003), we gathered primary data by interviewing key informants involved in the following social enterprises: Greenius, Bayani Brew, and ECHOstore Sustainable Lifestyle. We also examined publicly available data on these three companies, including those taken from their web sites, published articles, and other studies conducted on these companies. We analyzed our data using the following theoretical lenses: resource dependence theory and stakeholder theory. We also made references to existing social entrepreneurship literature to augment our analysis. Our case study research reveals that Philippine social enterprises indeed encounter tensions as they pursue both their economic and social objectives. Successfully reconciling dual bottom lines requires business acumen on the part of the social enterprise's owners/managers, who must not only know how to manage their internal operations efficiently, but also be able to leverage on the resources of stakeholders that are sympathetic to the enterprise's social mission. Developing a strong brand attached to a quality product is also critical. Our study contributes further to the vastly growing yet still largely unexplored area of social entrepreneurship in the country. It also provides some guidance not only to aspiring social entrepreneurs but also to business educators who could contribute to the development of a new breed of entrepreneurs and managers of mission-driven enterprises. Our study also shows policy makers that they should put in place measures that will encourage cross-sector collaborations between the private sector, government, and civil society.},

abstract={Social entrepreneurship has been promoted as a way to create community development. However, social entrepreneurship is a contested field of research. Critics tend to stress that social entrepreneurship is merely a crystallization of market-oriented neoliberal agendas, whereas proponents emphasize aspects such as solidarity and a new economy that is fundamentally different from capitalist market economy. This study takes up these discussions by relating them to how social entrepreneurship is enacted in practice. The study was conducted as ethnographic fieldwork in a Danish voluntary organization involved in social work and work integration and focuses on how dilemmas regarding social and economic goals are handled in the everyday practice. The findings of the study show that, rather than representing either a market-oriented or a solidarity-oriented approach in pure form, the organization demonstrates co-existence of both paradigms of solidarity and neoliberalism. It is argued that precisely this interplay between the paradigms might be a distinguishing feature of social entrepreneurship that could be understood in terms of Foucault's notion of heterotopia as an 'other space'. This feature of social entrepreneurship holds both potentials as well as challenges when creating new types of community development. © Oxford University Press and Community Development Journal 2015.},

abstract={Purpose-The purpose of this paper is to analyse the role of social enterprises in building social capital and strengthening social bonds. Design/methodology/approach-The analysis is based on the comparative method. The author compares the development of social entrepreneurship of the "old" social economy (born on the turn of nineteenth and twentieth centuries), and of the "new" social economy (developing on the turn of twentieth and twenty-first centuries); and the functioning of social enterprises of two kinds: work integration social enterprises (WISEs) and community-based social enterprises (CBSEs). Moreover, he distinguishes between economic and social re-integration; and reciprocity and vertical inclusion. Findings-The paper presents WISEs and CBSEs as tools of two different activation programmes: WISEs improve the employability of individuals who are marginalized in the labour market, while CBSEs serve as vehicles for the socio-economic development of the marginalized communities and territories. Furthermore, the author clarifies two methods of inclusion: through strengthening horizontal social ties (realized mainly by CBSEs, with their mutuality principle as a basis for building relations between participants) and building vertical social bonds (mainly by WISEs, based on the "inclusion of excluded" formula). Research limitations/implications-The paper stresses the importance of focusing research into social entrepreneurship on the role of social enterprises in shaping social bonds as well as using and producing of social capital of two main types: bonding and bridging. Practical implications-Recommendations for managing social enterprises as hybrid entities. The author argues that the most effective approach (in producing social value-added) is to combine the formula of the re-integration of individuals excluded from the labour market with the efforts to develop the whole local communities from marginalized territories. Originality/value-The author uses sociological perspectives in analysing economic entities and activation policies. © 2015 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

I identify definitions of ‘entrepreneurship’ and ‘social entrepreneurship’, and delve into the historical development of the concept ‘entrepreneur’. South Africa is in an era where it needs more new venture creation. Hence, I have studied new venture formation, especially from the perspective of Schumpeter’s theory of ways of forming a new firm. South Africa lags behind in new venture development compared to other developing countries; I investigated the causes behind this and suggest remedies to address this. Postfoundationalist practical theology is seen as a way of doing theology in the midst of those who suffer poverty and lack. The methods of this approach are dealt with in this article, which also asks what theology can bring to the table of interdisciplinary engagement?. © 2015, The Authors.},

abstract={Social innovation refers to the processes and outcomes that develop a novel approach to addressing a social problem or need. Compared to commercial innovation, it poses some distinctive challenges, particularly with regard to the incentives to invest in it, assessment of performance, and diffusion of effective innovations. Scholars began paying attention to this phenomenon in the late twentieth century, but many open research questions remain. The term 'social innovationa' has had two meanings in the academic literature. In its earliest scholarly uses, primarily in sociology, it was used to refer to the creation of new patterns of human interaction, new social structures, or new social relations. The second focuses on innovations designed to address a social or environmental issue or to meet a specific social market failure or need. Often, both types of innovation are combined to establish new patterns of social relations that have positive social outcomes. As Mulgan et al. (2007) argued, social innovations are "social both in their ends and their meansa" creating "new social relationships and collaborationsa" as well as responding to specific social needs (p. 2). This article provides an overview of the evolving field of social innovation globally. First, it introduces the term and sets out key definitions. Next, the chapter explores the key contexts and drivers of social innovation and maps the actors who engage with it. Following this, social innovation is located within academic theory. The next section considers some of the distinctive challenges faced by social innovation. The concluding section makes some final observations and sets out a future research agenda. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Scientific interest in social entrepreneurship is growing (Dacin et al., 2010; Short et al., 2009; Zahra et al., 2009). Like traditional entrepreneurs, social entrepreneurs see an opportunity to satisfy some unmet need, establish new organizations, develop and implement respective programs, and organize or distribute new products or services. They set themselves apart from traditional entrepreneurs primarily by following a social mission and by focusing on social needs-in areas such as education, welfare, the environment, and health care-that the state and the private sector do not or cannot adequately meet (Austin et al., 2006). To accomplish their social mission, social enterprises generally aim to maximize their social impact (for example, Sherman, 2006). They do so by maximizing social well-being of their targeted “underserved, neglected, or highly disadvantaged population” (Martin and Osberg, 2007: 35). The complexity of efficiently and effectively scaling social impact (the raison d’etre of the firm), though, is a challenge for social enterprises (Bloom and Smith, 2010; Bradach, 2003; Dees et al., 2004). This explains why the investigation into key conditions that enhance or limit the potential for scaling the impact of social enterprises has generated great interest in the theory and practice of social entrepreneurship equally (Bloom and Smith, 2010; Jenkins and Ishikawa, 2010; Sherman, 2006). © Phillip H.

abstract={The literature on the topic of entrepreneurship and small business has diversified and developed constantly since its first formulations. In the past 30 years, moreover, an independent field of studies has developed especially in the area of economics and business studies (Busenitz et al. 2003). While it can be argued that economic theory has still not furnished a thoroughgoing definition of entrepreneurial activity (Bull and Willard 1993), one may nevertheless note that what we know about entrepreneurship derives mainly from the early and classic studies of the twentieth century. This concerns Schumpeterian theories (Schumpeter 1934), the theories on ‘enterprise creation’ of Collins and Moore (1964), and Knight’s theory of risk (1921). According to these authors, the distinctive feature of entrepreneurial activity is a capacity for innovation. This, however, is regarded as being essentially a quality intrinsic to persons, rather than simultaneously a set of practices, so that some theoreticians have been explicit in criticizing the underlying Darwinian and heroic model of entrepreneurship. However, in recent years the debate has been enriched by new perspectives and has assumed a central role in other fields, organization studies for example. The past ten years, in fact, have seen a flourishing of approaches and perspectives ‘alternative’ and innovative with respect to the dominant paradigm. A first example is represented by the anthologies in the New Movements of Entrepreneurship series (Steyaert and Hjorth 2003; 2006; Hjorth and Steyaert 2004; 2009a), which present some of the more innovative qualitative research studies on entrepreneurship. © Elizabeth Chell and Mine Karataş-Özkan 2014.},

abstract={This article has two objectives: to clarify the organizational and managerial differences between social entrepreneurship and social enterprises and to investigate the role of social enterprises and their impacts on the welfare systems of European countries. The authors describe social entrepreneurship as a trend across all forms of enterprises and social enterprise as the institutionalization of a new typology that is distinguished by specific features from its inception. By relying on a theoretical analysis, the article supports the interpretation of social enterprise as an innovative institutional tool that can have a role in supporting growth and welfare. The essential features of social enterprise, which justify their competitiveness vis-à-vis public and for-profit organizations in the production and delivery of general-interest services, are thoroughly investigated. The article sheds light on the contribution of social enterprises to reforming and democratizing the traditional European welfare systems, which - since the 1980s - have revealed their inability to distribute welfare services inclusively and cope with the growing phenomena of poverty and inequalities.

abstract={What do social entrepreneurs do? Do they play any significant role in community development? Could they really play any meaningful roles in community development? These are some of the questions that were taken on in this paper which relied immensely on secondary data. To achieve a healthy infusion of the different misconceptions of the concept of social entrepreneurship, there was an unpacking of the terms social and entrepreneurship. What emerged was a finer articulation of a concept that counts on individuals or a group of them working together to address matters of significance to a set of people. Some examples of the good that social entrepreneurs can and have done are presented, while some of their challenges are highlighted. The paper concludes by recommending a further engagement of the subject in an empirical form to better ascertain their real impact. The paper also suggests an examination of the legislative frameworks that exist in other countries for the benefit of the South African government.},

abstract={Purpose: The aim of this paper is to contribute to the literature that has sought to deconstruct this ideologically driven depiction by demonstrating how the existent enterprise culture in post-Soviet spaces not only challenges the depiction of the entrepreneur as a heroic icon of the legitimate capitalist culture but also opens up the feasibility of alternative futures beyond legitimate profit-driven capitalism. The starting point of this paper is that the enterprise culture is often viewed as inextricably related to the legitimate capitalist economy. Design/methodology/approach: To unravel the nature of the enterprise culture in lived practice, this paper reports a 2006 survey involving face-to-face interviews with 90 entrepreneurs in Moscow. Findings: Only 7 per cent of the Muscovite entrepreneurs surveyed pursue profit-driven legitimate entrepreneurship. The vast majority adopts social goals to varying degrees and operates wholly or partially in the informal economy. The outcome is to challenge the depiction of an enterprise culture and capitalism as inextricably inter-related and to open up entrepreneurship and enterprise culture in this post-Soviet space to re-signification as demonstrative of the feasibility of imagining and enacting alternative futures beyond capitalism. Research limitations/implications: These findings are tentative, as they are based on a small-scale study of just one post-socialist city. Further research is now required to analyse whether the lived practices of entrepreneurship and enterprise cultures are similarly diverse in other post-Soviet spaces as well as beyond. Originality/value: This is the first paper to evaluate critically the assumption that enterprise culture is a part of the legitimate capitalist economy in post-Soviet spaces. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Its activities have intended to the social mission and profit orientation, but the foremost activity is in social mission whereas it conscious about social benefit and not in profit motive.Social enterprise, in running their business, has todeal with this dual motive that is focused on the social consciousness intensely. As the advanced nonprofit organization, social enterprise should construct their goal in creating the value to the community and also to achieve their sustainabilty by innovation. Social innovation is the basis for the social entreprises in doing their social mission and itrequires stages beginning with seeking an opportunity to provide solutions for the social problems from the internal and external sources of information and knowledge. They should manage their knowledge as their main source of innovation and afterward it will be impacted to their main objectives in creating social value.This research integrate construct from the theories of entrepreneurship, Innovation and Knowledge Management.

abstract={Social entrepreneurship and social economy are constantly growing on global scale in the last three decades in developed countries and in developing countries as well. Social entrepreneurship is an umbrella term for a wide range of innovative and dynamic international practices and discourses in social and environmental area. For some, the paradigm of social entrepreneurship is panacea solving the problem of market failure, while for others it means the further expansion and domination of business models in all aspects of modern life. The ability to operate social enterprises exists in many sectors, such as health, social and educational services, care for children and elderly, services related to leisure time, transport, production and sale of food and the environment protection. The importance of the social economy and entrepreneurship varies from country to country. Proportion of labor active population, which is involved in the field of social entrepreneurship, is much higher in developed countries than in transition and developing countries. In Europe social entrepreneurship is in the process of expansion, it is creating large number of jobs and opens up opportunities for economic and social development; indicator for the stated is the figure of 9 million people employed in the field of social entrepreneurship. Social entrepreneurship has not got the right opportunity in Croatia yet, there are some examples of good practice and attempts of civil society organizations towards the development of social entrepreneurship in cooperation with legislator and other relevant stakeholders. But so far, there are no concrete results and impacts of conducted National Strategy for creating an enabling environment for development of civil society, which is the first national document to mention social entrepreneurship.},

abstract={Social entrepreneurship has been defined and redefined, but the most widespread definitions prominently embed the notion of innovation in their definition. For many, social innovation and social entrepreneurship is largely the same. Social innovation only became a popular term a decade later. Social innovation describes the mechanism, the actual innovation, such as microfinance, micro-insurance or off-grid energy solutions. Social entrepreneur and the social enterprise are the actors driving social change through innovation. The fact that the expression “social innovation” made a popular entry on the scene and has pushed back the use of social entrepreneurship to some degree reflects the recognition that social entrepreneurs are not the only actors bringing about social innovation. Governments, businesses and large NGOs are discovering the potential for driving social change through innovative approaches either by themselves or in cooperation with social entrepreneurs. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.},

Then, social entrepreneurship presence and its promotion is analyzed both in the practices and services provided by the Madrid Development Agency in its "Madrid Emprende" incubation program and also through a survey addressed to the 113 firms hosted in its network of business incubators. Results of the survey show that social entrepreneurship is present as the main purpose of their activity in a majority of the firms, in their social products and services, in their social legal form supported by the public network and in some forms of public-private partnership promoted by the Madrid Business Incubators Network.

Design/methodology/approach - Primary information has been collected from National Level bodies like Fair Trade Forum - India (FTF-I) by means of discussions and debates. Current state of fair trade penetration has been discussed with the help of a case study of an India NGO, International Resources for Fairer Trade (IRFT) which is a pioneer in this field in India. Findings - Discussions with FTF-I and study of IRFT revealed some surprising facts about fair trade in India - one of them being the expected size of the fair trade market in the near future. Fair trade is expected to grow exponentially in the coming years and it has the potential be an inspiration for many to enter into the social entrepreneurship world. Practical implications - With this study as basis, many Non Government Organizations and other bodies may find that their business models can be slightly modified to make them eligible for entering the lucrative market of fair trade. Originality/value - This is the first study that focuses on attempting to find a link between social entrepreneurship and fair trade in India. This study will not only help current and future social entrepreneurs understand the need for fair trade and its benefits but it will also help them understand how they could become fair trade compliant if they wanted to and thus contribute to all inclusive growth. © 2011 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

We draw on the concepts of 'social capital' and 'social entrepreneurship' to identify tensions and possibilities for school leaders in a case study of a small rural school as they seek to find resources for school-community change. We found that the nature of social challenges increasingly demands that leaders adopt creative ways to counter social disadvantage. School leaders need to rethink existing resources and harness new opportunities for themselves and their communities with implications for the knowledge and skills required of principals and others in schools. The case study demonstrates that leadership for learning requires alternative ways of thinking about and accessing resources to support change for improvement.},

The second addresses continuities and changes in the symbiotic relationship between big coops and rural households within the two ongoing processes of Europeanization and economic globalization. The final section discusses the 'cooperative difference' and concludes with some analytical insights on who makes it both in coops and households.},

abstract={In this paper we propose a pedagogical strategy of juxtaposing Virgil's Aeneid—a canonical epic poem in Western literary tradition—and foundational economic texts in entrepreneurship theory by Joseph Schumpeter and Israel Kirzner. Our utilization of foundational texts of Schumpeter and Kirzner convey the “entrepreneurship” piece in teaching social entrepreneurship. They present students with elements of sound entrepreneurship, such as the novel intuitions and entrepreneurial discovery, the distinct role of the entrepreneur, and the causal functionality of entrepreneurship. Our utilization of Virgil's Aeneid conveys the “social” piece in teaching social entrepreneurship. Certain features distinguish social entrepreneurship from entrepreneurship's other forms, such as a community orientation and private sacrifice for public benefit. The figure of Aeneas in Virgil's Aeneid embodies these features and, we argue, is the quintessential social entrepreneur. Additionally, the structure of the poem puts into fictional and imaginative practice elements of Schumpeterian and Kirznerian entrepreneurship theory. The advantages of our pedagogical approach to teaching social entrepreneurship are that it provides sound entrepreneurship theory; illustrates the “social” in social entrepreneurship; and recognizes the interdisciplinary nature of social entrepreneurship studies. © 2010, Copyright The Journal of Small Business and Entrepreneurship.},

abstract={Even in simple contexts, the dynamical interaction between agents creates complex features. The presence of agents of change affects dramatically the underlying social structure. Some agents seem to be important in shaping the evolution of interactions: traditionally, these agents have been referred to as leaders; nevertheless, recently scholarly interest has been attracted by social entrepreneurs. Do social leaders and social entrepreneurs act differently? Can a social entrepreneurship culture, one that aims for a large number of social entrepreneurs, be welcomed? This paper presents a model of interaction among agents in a community, and sheds light on the catalytic role that some individuals have on the social structure. The results provide some implications about the role of social entrepreneurs and the differences between social entrepreneurship and leadership.},

It is based on positive social, economic, organizational, and/or physical changes that improve the general welfare of the community while providing services to a specific vulnerable population. The Pentru Voi Bakery, one of many programs operated for persons with intellectual disabilities by the Foundation, is used to showcase the key elements of successful ICD. These elements are partnerships, integration, innovation, and transferability. While all community development projects are inherently different, other NGOs interested in creating sustainable programs that utilize the collective agency of local, regional, and international partners can learn from this example. Community Development literature and social entrepreneurship literature are reviewed and discussed as they relate to the Pentru Voi model. Pentru Voi is framed as a practice model based upon the qualities of best practice outlined by the International Labor Office. © 2007 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This chapter focuses on high-profile social entrepreneurship (HPSE) and ways to expand it. HPSE represents a particular interpretation of social entrepreneurship (SE) that attracts considerable attention and support but is narrow in its location and scope. SE has the potential to address vital relationships across entrepreneurship and society (Steyaert and Katz, 2004). This chapter pursues that potential. First, it seeks to explain HPSE's narrowness by locating it within specific historical, economic, and social contexts (limited to the US). Then it pursues an expanded SE through three cases. The cases portray social action observed through an entrepreneurial lens and entrepreneurship through a social lens. Doing so illuminates three aspects of entrepreneurship that HPSE excludes: society as a field where entrepreneurial action occurs, social processes and entrepreneurial action as interdependent, and entrepreneurship as emergent in this field through these processes. These ideas extend Kaufman's (1985) cauldron metaphor of entrepreneurship, which is reframed as the social cauldron. © Chris Steyaert and Daniel Hjorth 2006. All rights reserved.},

It is further suggested that services need to become learning organizations, committed to values of inclusion and to living those values in their practice. Further, by promoting and celebrating innovation and creativity, by flattening hierarchical structures and promoting social entrepreneurship and cooperative working and inquiry, services can further develop person centredness in what they do and make a reality of the rhetoric in Valuing People.},

abstract={Compared with many other countries, the United States (US) lacks serious, institutionalised regional planning. Yet the US has large, highly developed, complicated metropolitan regions. This leads us to suspect that regional planning must have occurred in some capacity, even if it was not labelled as such. This paper argues that at least one type of forceful, heavily funded regional planning has occurred in the US over the past 60 years. It was performed largely under the aegis of transportation planning, and specifically, interstate highways through and around major cities. Focused primarily on the single function of moving motor vehicles, urban freeway planning has formed the armature for urban growth patterns in all of our major metropolises and their hinterlands, generating profound impacts on planning practice. The outcome has been a pattern of auto-dependent development. In the absence of comprehensive regional planning capable of weaving transportation, land use, and urban design together into an authentic urbanism, more balanced alternatives were not pursued. Freeway advocates proved to be powerful and effective 'social entrepreneurs', advancing their ideas forcefully in political forums for more than half a century. While decentralisation was bound to occur, for a host of economic, technological, and social reasons, there was nothing inevitable about the substitution of freeway planning for comprehensive regional planning. And while automobiles were destined to transform urban life, we have missed opportunities to tame their hostile impact on the public realm. The result has been a seriously unbalanced transportation system, and the fragmented landscape that goes along with it.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate how individuals' prosocial motivation affects their social entrepreneurship intentions (SEI) through the mediating effect of creativity and the moderating effect of family-to-work support. Design/methodology/approach: A questionnaire survey was conducted in the Pearl River Delta region in Guangdong, China, and data were collected from 318 respondents who had rich social work experience. To test the hypotheses, a hierarchical linear regression analysis was conducted using SPSS 24.0 software. Findings: Results offer empirical support for the hypotheses that creativity in social work plays a full mediating role in the relationship between individuals' prosocial motivation and SEI, and family-to-work support plays a positive moderating role in the relationship between creativity in social work and SEI. Research limitations/implications: This study shows the importance of prosocial motivation, creativity in social work and family support in driving individuals' social entrepreneurship intentions and behaviours. Future research needs to further examine how the dynamic relationships between these factors unfold over time, as well as consider the effect of other motivational factors on creativity and SEI. Practical implications: This study suggests that the cultivation of individual prosocial motivation is crucial and requires the efforts of family, school and society. Relevant organisations should encourage individuals to incorporate creative thinking into their work, as well as offer training opportunities. In addition, social entrepreneurs should also strengthen communication with their families and strive to gain their understanding and support. Originality/value: The findings of this study extend existing views on the relationship between individuals' motivation and entrepreneurship intentions in the social entrepreneurship research field by focusing on the perspective of prosocial motivation. In particular, this study reveals the complex process of how prosocial motivation promotes SEI by identifying the role of creativity and family-to-work support, which has rarely been explored in the extant literature. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: This study proposes personal network of social entrepreneurs as a key antecedent factor of their resource bricolage to understand the mechanisms underlying social entrepreneurial practices before the founding of social enterprises. Design/methodology/approach: An empirical study is used to collect and analyze data. The questionnaire data are drawn from in-depth semistructured interviews with Chinese social entrepreneurs. This study develops a theoretical framework that draws upon two dimensions of social capital, namely, “ownership” and “use,” to explore relationships among personal network, resource bricolage and relation strength. Findings: With data from 227 social enterprises in China, empirical results suggest that personal network of social entrepreneurs, that is, the “owned” social capital, shall be transformed by the intermediate role of resource bricolage into relation strength, that is, the “used” social capital. The relationship between resource bricolage and relation strength is positively moderated by the marketization degree and social class of social entrepreneurs. Research limitations/implications: This study introduces resource bricolage into the front-end course of social entrepreneurship. The results show that similar personal network can lead to different behavioral outcomes in the context of social entrepreneurship. Then the integration of resources and opportunities at the beginning of the social entrepreneurial process opens new avenues for future research. However, this study only investigates the transformation from network to resources implemented by social entrepreneurs before organization establishment. It does not explore potential outcomes of such a transformation for the development of social enterprises. Practical implications: Social entrepreneurs at the prefounding stage shall make use of the values of available resources, fully use potential interpersonal relations in the personal network, and transform these relations into a close, steady relationship to realize potential values of available resources. Social entrepreneurs can start from excavation and foundation laying of strong relation networks, to avoid problems in legality, social awareness and failure risks generated from blind integration of external resources. Originality/value: This study finds that social entrepreneurship exists between the motivation of the social entrepreneur and the establishment of the organization after the development over time. Creating first a phased result through the resource bricolage is necessary. This result establishes a complete process chain of social entrepreneurship from motivation to behavior, next to organization establishment and subsequent development. This study is an empirical test based on the theoretical interpretation to make a positive effect on the social entrepreneurship research in the theoretical construction and testing of the deficiencies. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

We argue that a collective perspective on social entrepreneurship in the tourism context is needed, and introduce a concept and framework for ‘Collective Tourism Social Entrepreneurship’ (CTSE).

A literature review of social entrepreneurship journals was conducted, resulting in identifying four key dimensions in social entrepreneurship which are social, economic, behaviour and governance. These four dimensions have been categorised to have an effect on social entrepreneurship and sustainability. Additionally, the theory of change and logic model are business processes that have been identified, extending into the measurement of social impact by using either the social return on impact or balanced scorecard approach to complete the conceptual framework. Hence, this study is envisioned to provide original work in the theoretical development of linking social entrepreneurship to sustainability that will benefit academicians and practitioners alike. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={As we confront social, ecological and economic challenges, some look to a new model described as the purpose economy as a pathway to more sustainable and just futures. Responsible and sustainable events are increasingly of interest to both academics and practitioners. However, little work has explored the capacities for social entrepreneurship in events management and ways that events can build socio-cultural well-being. This article presents a case study of an unusual events business known as GOGO Events located in Adelaide, South Australia. For some eight years, GOGO has offered a social enterprise initiative training and supporting teams of marginalised people to create and install event installations. To accomplish this, GOGO’s founder has built a web of stakeholders, including: corporate clients; not for profit organisations supporting homeless and vulnerable people; and these vulnerable people themselves. Together they build networks of care and social change. Using the lens of feminist care ethics, we analyse how such work contributes to building the purpose economy. These efforts move beyond corporate social responsibility and suggest events businesses can help build community, create relationships of care and contribute to more sustainable and fair futures. After COVID-19, such socially committed work has become even more imperative. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Third-party endorsements are appreciated in entrepreneurial ventures since they help signal the value of an idea and the trustworthiness of an entrepreneur. They contribute therefore to reducing ‘information asymmetry’, always present in an entrepreneur-investor relationship. However, the role of third-party endorsements in for-profit contexts might differ from that in prosocial contexts. In prosocial contexts, investors are interested not only in financial returns but also in creating a social impact. On the one hand, the endorsement might signal trustworthiness, while on the other, it might also signal that the entrepreneur already has some financial support and thus is less in need than an entrepreneur with no support at all. Investors seeking to maximize their social impact might perceive the social impact generated by funding an endorsed entrepreneur as smaller than the social impact created by funding an entrepreneur with no support at all. This study analyzes these contradictions through the lens of signaling theory and explores the role of third-party endorsements in the success of entrepreneurial projects in the context of online social crowdfunding. A comparison of different types of endorsements shows that having a pro bono endorsement provides the best equilibrium between the number of investors and dollars per investor. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Migrations from rural to urban areas do not occur equitably. Food, economic, and health systems are strained by this global rural–urban transformation. Climate change exacerbates agricultural shifts and biodiversity loss. The fields of social entrepreneurship and social innovation address these systemic inequities by re-envisioning challenges as opportunities for positive change. Innovative finance models (e.g. blended-financing, public–private partnerships) emerge in support of such initiatives. Despite this transformative potential, social innovators face significant challenges when mobilizing resources, and when moving beyond niche endeavors to scale impacts that facilitate systemic change. This article engages in a sensemaking exercise: we review literature on social entrepreneurship and innovative finance, and report outcomes from a participatory symposium in China with a variety of ecosystem stakeholders.

This study aims to empirically examine the relationship between social entrepreneurship and regional economic development, focusing on government-driven social enterprises in South Korea. I conduct an exploratory study of government support for social enterprises in South Korea at the local and central government level and empirically examine the relationship between social entrepreneurship and regional economic development by using time sequential panel data collected over an eight-year period from 2007 to 2014. Results from panel regression (fixed-effect and random-effect) models indicate that social entrepreneurship measured as the number of government-driven social enterprises has a positive relationship with regional economic development. As claimed in numerous previous studies on regional economic development, the fixed-effect regression results of this study also indicate that physical capital, human capital, knowledge capital, and entrepreneurship are all significant and important factors shaping regional economic output. The results of this study suggest a new direction for policy that focuses on instruments to promote social entrepreneurship. Thus, governments of each region need to make efforts to promote job creation in social enterprises because they possess the ability to efficiently respond to the immediate needs of local social enterprises. These government-driven social enterprises can contribute to regional economic development through creating new jobs in South Korea. © 2020 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

This paper examines the innovative social entrepreneurial processes using the theoretical foundation of responsible innovation (i.e., anticipation, reflexivity, inclusion and deliberation, responsiveness, and knowledge management). The data collected from three case study organisations reveals that social enterprises at the initiation stage address only a few SDGs. However, innovation development and implementation processes lead to products and services diversification and geographical expansion which broaden the SDG focus. During this process, enterprises iteratively conduct activities associated with different dimensions of responsible innovation and operate within ethics, values and rights-based boundaries. Based on these findings, this paper proposes a process model combining SDG literature with responsible innovation. The managerial implications of using responsible innovation perspective to achieve SDGs are also highlighted.

Using two SHS companies, Boond and Selco, as case studies, this article uses narrative interviews with key employees to identify the often overlooked, or invisible, micro-activities that social enterprises need to sustain themselves in rural BoP markets. This study examines the relationship between social entrepreneurship, rural BoP market characteristics, and challenges related to energy access, by combining the business model frameworks of social entrepreneurship and off-grid solar. Using narrative theory, it identifies three key activities and associated risks: community engagement, stakeholder management, and organizational capacity building. Social enterprises ought to engage in these three activities in order to manage the high-risk environment in the rural BoP markets. Community engagement bolsters social trust and results in customized solutions for the end-user; stakeholder management creates a favourable business environment and is a determinantal risk proposition; and finally, organizational capacity-building enables businesses to deliver reliable services, by increasing overall human resource management efficiency, while building social trust. Through a risk assessment of social entrepreneurial activities, practitioners and stakeholders can navigate the risk-based nature of rural SHS markets. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

While much has been written on the branding of sustainable fashion, little is known about the positioning strategies that have both sustainability and fashion appeal. This study aims to fill the gap, guided by the research question: how sustainability and product functionality-related aspects are dealt with while positioning a fashion brand? Using an illustrative case study of an Indian social enterprise, Upasana, we explore how fashion brands identify and work on a positioning strategy that balances the fashion and sustainability-related aspects of their products. Our paper is based on multiple site visits over the last seven years, email communications, direct observations, analysis of the company website, brochures, and in-depth interviews with the founder. Our findings suggest three aspects that should be highlighted in the positioning of a sustainable fashion brand: (i) authenticity of the products and business processes (ii) local and/or traditional aspects of the product including its design (iii) an appealing backstory with market relevance. By uncovering the brand positioning strategies adopted by a social enterprise, this article contributes to our understanding of how sustainable fashion brands can create a favorable image among the stakeholders. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Our systematic review of 133 articles develops a better understanding of this scaling process. From the literature, we conceptualize impact as the result of two different pathways: ‘scaling out’ (extending geographical space or volume) and ‘scaling up’ (influence on public discourses, political agendas and legislation). The review identified strategy, actor characteristics and institutional environment as key factors for scaling. The literature indicates that for strategy a focus on open structures generates speed and higher impact, but we also found critical views on this. The literature shows that the actor characteristics such as the ambition to scale, equal focus on the economic and the social logic, entrepreneurial skills and leadership are positively related to the level of impact. The institutional environment influences actor characteristics and strategy choices and also has a direct effect on the level of social and sustainable impact. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={In the Netherlands, there is an increasing need for collective forms of housing for older people. Such housing bridges the gap between the extremes of living in an institutionalised setting and remaining in their own house. The demand is related to the closure of many residential care homes and the need for social engagement with other residents. This study focuses on housing initiatives that offer innovative and alternative forms of independent living, which deviate from mainstream housing arrangements. It draws on recent literature on healthcare ‘rebels’ and further develops the concept of ‘rebellion’ in the context of housing. The main research question is how founders dealt with challenges of establishing and governing ‘rebellious’ innovative living arrangements for older people in the highly regulated context of housing and care in the Netherlands. Qualitative in-depth interviews with 17 founders (social entrepreneurs, directors and supervisory board members) were conducted. Founders encountered various obstacles that are often related to governmental and sectoral rules and regulations. Their stories demonstrate the opportunities and constraints of innovative entrepreneurship at the intersection of housing and care. The study concludes with the notion of ‘responsible rebellion’ and practical lessons about dealing with rules and regulations and creating supportive contexts. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this study is to help us understand social entrepreneurs’ lived experiences, reflecting the comprehensive entrepreneurial processes that encompass their past, present and future. Design/methodology/approach: A narrative approach was used to explore the meaning of experiences in social entrepreneurs’ professional lives through the stories retold and restructured by social entrepreneurs. A total of 11 social entrepreneurs in the Midwest region of the USA were interviewed. Findings: The authors identified three time-sequential themes: past (looking backward at the origin), present (living life as a social entrepreneur) and future (looking forward). Seven sub-themes emerged, revealing social entrepreneurs’ aspiration, self-knowledge, identity-defining moments, their sustainability-oriented leadership and how they build an organizational structure, partnership and handle the burden of work and the organization. Practical implications: The findings offer useful information for future social entrepreneurs as they can learn from the perspectives of experienced social entrepreneurs in terms of what to prepare for and expect so they can achieve their full entrepreneurial potential. It can also aid in further development of social entrepreneur curricula in business and non-business schools. Originality/value: The existing literature does not portray sufficient detail about how social entrepreneurs live the lives they have created and chosen to understand their lived experiences. This study also provides a comprehensive definition of social entrepreneurship, incorporating “collective perspective” with a mentality of “it’s not about me, it’s about us”. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Past research about social entrepreneurial intention has centered on the impact of bright personalities; however, dark personalities such as the dark triad are also considered to have advantages. This study explored the relationship between the dark triad and social entrepreneurial intention by focusing on the mediating role of moral disengagement and the moderating role of empathic concern and perspective taking. Based on a sample of 491 undergraduates and 412 students in a master in business administration program in China, the dark triad was found to be negatively related to social entrepreneurial intention through moral disengagement. Moreover, high levels of empathic concern and perspective taking weakened the direct effect of the dark triad on moral disengagement, as well as the indirect effect of the dark triad on social entrepreneurial intention. Our study extends the research in the field of personality and entrepreneurship. Given the findings on the role of moral disengagement, empathic concern, and perspective taking, education efforts may assist in decreasing the negative effects of the dark triad on social entrepreneurial intention. © Copyright © 2020 Wu, Su, Huang, Liu and Jiang.},

abstract={Social innovation is critical for supporting the economic and social fabric of communities globally. Yet little is known about the processes through which social innovation occurs and how context shapes them. To date, scholarship has focused primarily on social entrepreneurs and social enterprise creation, while the role of established not-for-profits (NFPs) as agents of social innovation has received surprisingly little attention given their importance to communities. It is expected that innovation will be increasingly important for NFPs as shifts in their funding models create greater complexity in maintaining sustainability and continuity in social service delivery. This research generates a deeper understanding of the processes of social innovation within NFPs by examining how multiple levels of context influence the behaviors of a key set of agents: innovation champions. Adopting an interactionist lens, the study explores how shifts in funding policy at the macro level, and the role of leaders (CEOs and Boards) and organizational institutional logics at the meso level, influence champion behavior at the micro level. To do this, we draw on sensemaking as an important cognitive and action-enabling mechanism. A qualitative, multicase study design with 46 interviews across six case organizations allows an in-depth exploration of this under-investigated area. The findings indicate that bricolage activity can facilitate championing that supports social innovation within NFPs and that organizational context guides the direction and content of champion behavior. The findings further uncover a broader range of behaviors and outcomes than have been previously attributed to champions, while highlighting the critical role that bricolage-enabled championing can play in driving social innovation that is both directly impactful and offers significant longer-term social impact. The important roles that sensebreaking, sensegiving, and sensemaking play in connecting champions’ interpretations of their contexts to their behaviors are also outlined. © 2020 Product Development & Management Association},

abstract={This study builds upon the literature around tensions, conflicts, and mission drift in social enterprises (SEs) to provide a clearer understanding of how SEs position themselves and which strategies can more effectively prevent a shift toward pure social or pure commercial outcomes. We conducted an in-depth investigation of 10 SEs in Italy and the UK contextualized in the food and beer industries. We produced a theoretical framework shedding light on the possible strategies to deal with sources of conflict and applied a csQCA to identify the most effective combination of strategies in preventing mission drift: mixed ownership and financial resource mobilization. We discuss that differences between the countries emerged due to some of the paradoxes of SEs in these industries. This is seemingly the first study adopting a csQCA in such a context, and it proved to be suitable for studying social entrepreneurship in homogenizing variables, hardly comparable otherwise. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The highest number of forcibly displaced people has been currently recorded due to war, poverty, and climate change. Recently, a process that recognizes refugees as reliable interlocutors for the improvement of reception policies has started. Refugees are therefore encouraged to start up social enterprises aimed at fostering newcomers’ social integration to participate to such a phenomenon. Positive Psychology, with its focus on human strengths, allows to identify the resources that pushed refugees to turn the difficulties they faced during the journey and the resettlement process into resources for themselves and for the resettlement community. The following paper explores in particular the interplay between social and psychological capital that is at the base of a similar social entrepreneurship project through a case study. A qualitative research has been carried out within a social enterprise with a migratory background to analyze the internal and relational resources that brought founders to start up the venture. Results show that while social and psychological capital were independently activated to start from scratch in the resettlement community, they occurred in interrelation in a subsequent phase when participants transformed their direct experiences related to migration into the human capital of their enterprise. © Copyright © 2020 Modesti, Talamo, Nicolais and Recupero.},

abstract={The objective of this work is to analyze how Social Entrepreneurial Ecosystems (SEE) in low-vulnerability and high-vulnerability regions of a country may influence the creation and operation of social ventures. To do so the study follows one of the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor’s (GEM) surveys, the National Experts Survey (NES). Particularly, the instrument from 2015 when the GEM teams around the globe made a unique effort to collect data for a special topic report on social entrepreneurship including eight questions to measure social entrepreneurship as an additional section of the survey. The authors used the case of Mexico because the GEM national team collected NES responses in 5 of the 32 entities within the country (Guanajuato, Jalisco, Puebla, Querétaro, and San Luis Potosí) that year. Therefore, considering demographic and economic indicators the entities were grouped into two regions according to their levels of vulnerability. The resulting pool of data of regional NES responses in Mexico during 2015 was a total of N=188 experts, 74 located in High Vulnerability (HV) regions, and 114 in Low Vulnerability (LV) regions. The authors used non-parametric statistics to compare the differences between both regions. The results suggest that experts in low vulnerability regions perceived more favorable conditions for social entrepreneurs than in high vulnerability regions. The SEE in Mexico seems to be more consolidated in central regions where the main actors carry out most of their activities. Therefore, social entrepreneurs may face higher challenges to create and operate social ventures in peripheral regions. This study contributes to the empirical literature in regional Entrepreneurial Ecosystems (EE) by analyzing local ecosystems grouped by regions that share similar levels of vulnerability. This research also sheds light on how the EE may have conditions that can also promote the creation and development of social ventures even though the objective of these ecosystems are not primarily social but economic. In this sense, promoting an EE may favor the creation of SEE, although the latter is most needed in peripheral regions which traditionally experience higher levels of vulnerability. © 2020, Allied Business Academies.

abstract={Purpose: From the perspective of role identity theory, the purpose of this paper is to explain how an artistic creative entrepreneur has set up and operates a business that incorporates a component of social responsibility into the business model. Design/methodology/approach: An explanatory case study approach was followed in analysing the case of Alenka Repic, the founder and creative director of the company Kaaita, which operates from Slovenia. Data were collected through documentation and interviews and content analysis was used to analyse the data. Findings: Kaaita has adopted an innovative and socially responsible business model as an artistic creative enterprise. The case study firstly introduces Kaaita and its innovative business model. Thereafter, it describes and discusses the defining roles of Alenka Repic as an entrepreneur and how these roles have shaped what Kaaita does and how it operates. Research limitations/implications: This explanatory case study has presented the unique case of an artistic creative social entrepreneur, and the innovative business model that has been adopted. However, because only one case has been presented here, it is recommended that additional case studies be conducted. It is also recommended that additional research be conducted in the area of sustainable business model innovation. Practical implications: The case illustrates how a more deliberate consideration of their role identity could assist entrepreneurs in aligning their personal values and beliefs with how they create, operate and develop their enterprise. It also serves as a reminder to both scholars and aspiring entrepreneurs that the essence of entrepreneurship is to have the passion and courage to be innovative and disruptive and that educators should focus on cultivating skills that are related to identifying and exploiting opportunities for innovative disruption. Originality/value: The study draws on role identity theory to gain insight into the roles that are exercised in developing an innovative business model that combines diverse types of entrepreneurship. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Do social entrepreneurs running a for-profit (private, limited) enterprise require different competencies from those running a not-for-profit enterprise? The present research study aimed to answer the above question by proposing and vindicating a multidimensional competency construct that can serve as a succinct base to distinguish for-profit social entrepreneurs from not-for-profit social entrepreneurs. An online survey method was used to elicit responses from 400 Indian social entrepreneurs. Logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the data and to test the hypothesis. The empirical results revealed that for-profit social entrepreneurs did not differ not-for-profit social entrepreneurs in four competencies. By vindicating the competencies relevant for the two different forms of social enterprises, the study contributes to theory development in the field of social entrepreneurship. Furthermore, the study makes an attempt to explore new avenues for social entrepreneurial competencies research, which offer special insight with regard to enterprise form/type. The logistic regression model provides valuable insights for future enquiries by postulating and vindicating competencies as an underpinning for differentiation. The research study is limited to India; hence, it provides scope for further research in other geographical regions in order to generalize the results. © 2017 Kasetsart University.

This paper draws on a study of twenty projects delivered under the auspices of NHS Wales and the first implementation phase of the Rural Health Plan (2010-11); key themes of which include access, integration and, community cohesion and engagement. The need for speed of induced innovation emphasises reactivity in some instances and transfer of practices from more developed (or urban) environments to rural communities without acknowledgement of cultural, social and economic contexts and conditions. Inclusion of social enterprise practitioners, particularly those with community development and capacity building expertise in co-production of services may allow for the development of integrated and innovative working across health and social care, which may also be more aligned with a Welsh focus on prudent healthcare. In this respect, the paper considers the role of social enterprise in identifying and fostering innovation in low income, rural areas in ways that provide close-to-patient/service user services and address local issues and health determinants to provide more sustainable and resilient community based health and social care provision. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In this paper we assess the internal factors that influence effective opportunity identification in a social enterprise. Although previous studies have identified personal and organizational characteristics that may spur the search for new venture opportunities, there has been little research to assess the controllable factors that lead to sustainable outcomes. The need for greater understanding is particularly important in the context of enterprises affected by climate change and other macro-environmental challenges. We address this knowledge gap through thematic analysis of 15 semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders associated with the Tongan National Youth Congress. This organization helps young people in the small, climate-threatened south Pacific island country of Tonga to develop micro-enterprises. Our findings suggest that more creative entrepreneurial and marketing approaches need to be tempered by more analytical business management approaches if organizations are to identify opportunities that they can effectively and sustainably exploit using their own resources and those of partner organizations. Entrepreneurs need to ask ‘how can we make this idea viable?’ early in the opportunity identification process, rather than later. We recommend further qualitative and quantitative studies be undertaken using larger samples in other contexts to improve the generalizability of links between creative and analytical capabilities and effective opportunity identification. © 2018, © 2018 Journal of the Canadian Council for Small Business and Entrepreneurship/Conseil de la PME et de l'entrepreneuriat.},

abstract={Nature-based adult day services (ADSs) for people with dementia (PwD) are well-known in rural areas. In recent years, a number of providers have started offering these services in urban contexts, e.g., in city farms and community gardens, where people with dementia participate in outdoor activities, such as gardening and caring for animals. At the moment, little is known about these services within an urban context, and the aim of this study is to characterize different types of nature-based ADSs in urban areas for PwD living at home, as well as to identify general and specific challenges with regard to the development of different types of ADSs. An inventory was carried out and 17 ADS providers in urban areas were interviewed about their initiatives, settings, client groups, motivations for starting their nature-based ADS, and their experiences with, competences for, and funding of urban nature-based ADS. The interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and thematically analyzed. Five types of nature-based ADSs were identified: (1) services offered by social entrepreneurs, (2) nursing homes opening their garden to people with dementia, (3) social care organization setting up nature-based, (4) community garden set up by citizens, and (5) hybrid initiatives. Common activities were gardening, preparing meals, and taking care of farm animals. The main activities organized by nursing homes included sitting and walking in the garden and attending presentations and excursions. General challenges included the availability of green urban spaces and acquiring funding for the nature-based services. Initiatives of social entrepreneurs depended strongly on their commitment. Challenges for nursing homes included a lack of commitment among nursing staff, involvement of PwD living at home and a lack of interaction with the neighborhood. Volunteers played a key role in the initiatives organized by social care organizations and in community gardens. However, it was a major challenge to find volunteers who know enough about care and gardening. Specific challenges for the hybrid types were related to differences in work culture between social entrepreneurs and care organizations. Different types of care-oriented and community-oriented nature-based adult day services in urban areas for people with dementia have been developed, facing different types of challenges. Care oriented initiatives like nursing homes opening their garden focus on risk prevention and their nature-based services tended to be less diverse and stimulating for people with dementia living at home. Collaboration between such care-oriented initiatives with initiatives of other types of organizations or social entrepreneurs can lead to more appealing community-oriented nature-based services. © 2019 by the authors.

Relevant publications (14 on social entrepreneurship, 40 on marketing in non-profit organizations and social enterprises and 41 papers on marketing) are selected and reviewed. The result of the literature analysis and synthesis show that social enterprises can gain from a more formal, systematic approach to marketing. Since social enterprises prioritize social goals over business results, successful adoption of marketing policies and practices can help then create a blueprint for responsible marketing. Marketing of socially relevant products and services by social enterprises thus create a new paradigm of responsible marketing. Such models can also be useful for larger corporations who look at social business and shared value creation as part of their business and marketing strategy. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={How do members of a profession, initially reluctant to use quantification, finally accept it and change their expertise accordingly? This paper examines the processes by which a group of social workers in a social enterprise came to adhere to the claimed benefits of quantitative templates in framing the social problems of individuals and ways of addressing them. We also reflect on consequences ensuing from this important shift in social work expertise. We build our insights from an ethnographic study conducted in a social enterprise in France, where the management had recently been taken over by social entrepreneurs. The latter were especially concerned in rendering their organization's social workers more focused on strengthening the employability of beneficiaries, particularly through the compulsory use of quantified grids of evaluation. Our analysis brings to light the strategic initiatives and main conditions of possibility that collectively played a role in strengthening social worker receptivity towards quantification and in modifying the nature of their expertise. Specifically, we found that the core of social work expertise was altered in three main ways: strengthening of emotional boundaries between expert and beneficiary; downplaying the victimhood (of beneficiaries) as a key referent; and development of a breach in the claim of exclusivity in the relationship between social worker and beneficiary. This shift in expertise has deep consequences on the kind of person social work aims to produce; the emphasis is now on the development of individuals capable of being employed in the labor market. For now, at least in the social enterprise we studied, the economic conception of social work increasingly prevails over the traditional, emotionally and psychologically-based template. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

We present an institutional framework comprising cultural leadership styles (normative institutions), government effectiveness (regulatory institutions), and societal trust (cognitive institutions) to predict individual likelihood of social entrepreneurship. Using the insight of culture-entrepreneurship fit and drawing on institutional configuration perspective we posit that culturally endorsed implicit leadership theories (CLTs) of charismatic and participatory leadership positively impact the likelihood of individuals becoming social entrepreneurs. Further, we posit that this impact is particularly pronounced when a country's regulatory quality manifested by government effectiveness is supportive of social entrepreneurship and when there exist high levels of societal trust. Research on CLTs and their impact on entrepreneurial behavior is limited. We contribute to comparative entrepreneurship research by introducing a cultural antecedent of social entrepreneurship in CLTs and through a deeper understanding of their interplay with national-level institutions to draw the boundary conditions of our framework. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Social enterprises viewed as viable from societal perspectives are often regarded differently from traditional business perspectives. To examine this difference, we undertook two empirical studies of risk tolerance and legitimacy perceptions among observers of social enterprise and for-profit ventures. In Study 1, participants (n = 115) drawn randomly from Amazon's Mechanical Turk, an online crowdsourcing marketplace for human intelligence tasks, examined two hypothetical cases and completed the risk tolerance scale of the Jackson Personality Inventory. Results show that social enterprises were seen as having lower industry legitimacy, especially by individuals with lower risk tolerance. Here, industry legitimacy mediated the effect of venture purpose on cognitive legitimacy. In Study 2, practicing entrepreneurs (n = 23) narratively interpreted Study 1 results from social enterprise and traditional business perspectives. Both studies demonstrate that social enterprise legitimacy evaluations vary based on risk tolerance and the type of legitimacy in question. Overall findings show that explicit observations of risk tolerance effects, and multidimensional conceptualizations of legitimacy, are important to accurate evaluations of social enterprises. © 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2019.},

We also investigate whether being involved in social innovation is associated with even higher job satisfaction and well-being. Indeed, understood as a manifestation of positive social change, social innovation is expected to improve outcomes such as the quality of life at work. However, because social innovation is an umbrella concept, it embraces different innovation-related concepts. Here we explore the distinction between service innovation and workplace innovation.

abstract={Delivery of affordable healthcare services to communities is a necessary precondition to poverty alleviation. Co-creation approaches to the development of business models in the healthcare industry proved particularly suitable for improving the health-seeking behavior of BOP patients. However, scant research was conducted to understand BOP consumers' decision-making process leading to specific healthcare choices in slum settings, and the relative balance of sociocultural and socio-economic factors underpinning patients' preferences. This article adopts a mixedmethod approach to investigate the determinants of BOP patients' choice between private and public hospitals. Quantitative analysis of a database, composed of 436 patients from five hospitals in Ahmedabad, India, indicates that BOP patients visit a public hospital significantly more than topof- the-pyramid (TOP) patients. However, no significant difference emerges between BOP and TOP patients for inpatient or outpatient treatments. Qualitative findings based on 21 interviews with BOP consumers from selected slum areas led to the development of a grounded theory model, which highlights the role of aspirational demand of BOP patients toward private healthcare providers. Overall, healthcare provider choice emerges as the outcome of a collective socio-cultural decision-making process, which often assigns preference for private healthcare services because of the higher perceived quality of private providers, while downplaying affordability concerns. Implications for healthcare providers, social entrepreneurs, and policy-makers are discussed. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={Value creation is a constitutive and defining aspect in organizational ventures. This is unsurprising, as it is required for organizational survival and sustainability. Approaches based on the creation of economic, social and ecological value draw attention to the multiple and multiplicative nature of value creation. While academia still acknowledges the conceptual value of such approaches, a framework that add a psychological dimension to the established Elkington's triple-bottom line model seems particularly refreshing and inspiring. Relying on the concepts of psychological value and sustainability, this paper presents the outcomes of an exploratory empirical study involving managers and users/customers of four organizations in the social sector in Portugal. This study discusses how managers and users/customers of these organizations make sense of and value psychological value. The outcomes of the interviews with both managers and users/customers shed light into the unexplored, hazy and neglected analytical links that may exist between psychological value and broader perspectives on sustainability. We conclude that this novel approach enhances our understanding about the impact that a social product can have in societal sustainability. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={The bottom of the pyramid (BOP) market has gained importance in international entrepreneurship due to its large market potential. Drawing on the literature of international business education, as well as social entrepreneurship and international entrepreneurship education, we propose a course to educate students how to develop business intimacy with the BOP community. We employ the experiential-learning pedagogical framework and design elements including a short-term study abroad service trip, an entrepreneurship project, and structured reflections. Using both qualitative and quantitative data, we demonstrate that the course facilitates students’ learning in the key areas of international and social entrepreneurship, including the economic and social value of community embeddedness for BOP ventures, the emotional intelligence in interacting with BOP communities, and the attitude toward social entrepreneurship. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Purpose: This paper aims to explore the availability of new legal models for social enterprise development in Australia, asking the question: what does a distinctive focus on legal form add to the scholarly exploration of social enterprise? The paper has a dual purpose: firstly, to present a general empirical review of the fact, possible causes and implications of the absence of new legal models for social enterprise in Australia; and secondly, to make a polemical argument highlighting some of the advantages of developing a distinctive legal structure for social entrepreneurs in Australia. Design/methodology/approach: The paper reconciles two contending accounts. One would stress the absence of new legal models (the “gap” analysis). The other would acknowledge the absence of new legal models, while stressing the relevance of existing legal models for pursuing social enterprise goals. Both accounts are descriptively true, but the tension between them relates in part to the level of analysis (legal-political, collective voluntary action or bottom-up individual actors) and, in part, to longstanding tensions in the conceptualisation of social enterprise. Findings: The paper provides evidence of the rising salience of existing cooperative legal forms, rising diversity in the legal model choices of individual social enterprises and the emergence of two significant bottom-up developments in voluntary model rules. The legal-political bottleneck that remains is related to the constitutional structure of federal and state power, key macro-political policy trends in the late 1990s and the distinctive nature of the Australian “wage-earners” welfare state settlement. Originality/value: The paper highlights that what may appear as a “gap” in the legal landscape of Australian social enterprise is more nuanced. Despite the striking absence of any distinct new legislated legal models, the overall situation is a complex landscape providing multiple threads for weaving together diverse forms of social enterprise. Although legal frameworks may not be as salient as governance design choices, they generate three important second-order effects: signalling, legitimation and professional networks. Taken together, these may support a case for the distinctive value of a specific hybrid legal model for social enterprise. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: Work integration social enterprises (WISEs) address the chronic unemployment of disadvantaged populations. However, WISEs face challenges, in part, because they embody both social mission and market logics which potentially contradict one another. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how the founders of WISEs perceive the relationship between logics and how they manage any resulting tensions, to help determine if they are effective vehicles for alleviating unemployment. Design/methodology/approach: This study used in-depth interviews with social entrepreneurs in nationally recognized WISEs to assess how they perceived and managed logic tensions. Findings: A total of eight out of the ten WISEs emphasized one dominant logic and did not perceive significant internal conflict. Only two cases experienced prolonged and ultimately irreconcilable tensions between their social mission and market goals, when social entrepreneurs were guided by the blended logics of providing training and services to disadvantaged populations within a for-profit legal form. Research limitations/implications: Future research is required to determine the generalizability of these findings due to small sample size, an exclusive focus on the founder’s perspective and an exclusive focus on WISEs. Practical implications: Findings contribute to greater understanding of logic tensions in WISEs and the opportunities and limitations that result from aligning dominant logic(s) and organizational form. Originality/value: This research suggests that the founders of WISEs perceive market and social mission logics as options to be selected, and that WISEs struggle to succeed as organizations with two dominant logics. The market appears as yet unprepared to support singlehandedly organizations with a social mission of work integration. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Entrepreneurship can be defined as a process of creating value by searching and creating some opportunities. Entrepreneurial organizations are known as the firms which do not abstain from taking risks while trying to create something new from different opportunities on the basis of organization, product, foundation, service, and process. Environment and society are the main factors for the entrepreneurs who should perfectly analyze the society for being beneficial to others. Gender is becoming popular as a new entrepreneurial field for creating an original idea. Today’s business world needs the coordination between personal issues and social issues while acting entrepreneurial. In this point, women become popular and play vital roles to be able to create different beneficial and entrepreneurial acts as a part of the society and global business environment. Besides men, the number of women entrepreneurs increase seriously day by day. The main purpose of this chapter is to find out and emphasize the importance of social entrepreneurship in business and social environment based on the perceived social support and its dimensions. Besides, traditional and social entrepreneurship, the status of male and female entrepreneurs, the features of entrepreneurs, and the relationship between perceived social support and social entrepreneurship with the participation of 302 undergraduate students from Mersin Toros University/Turkey will be emphasized and some suggestions will be noted to encourage people to become successful in the society and to develop upcoming future studies. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.},

However, research is only beginning to explore the unique function social entrepreneurs fill in the marketplace. This conceptual article examines if social entrepreneurs indeed represent a novel category of market actor. Building on prior work claiming that the unique function of social entrepreneurs is the creation of positive externalities and generation of spillover benefits for society, we compare social entrepreneurs with conventional entrepreneurs and other entities that seek to increase social welfare, including governments and traditional nonprofit organisations. Specifically, we contend that the strengths of social entrepreneurship are its reliance on voluntary exchange, promotion of dignity and self-sufficiency in beneficiaries, attunement to the signals of the marketplace and ability to tap into consumer spending. We also uncover the limitations of social entrepreneurship, which include the challenge of combining multiple institutional logics, the existence of social issues around which viable businesses cannot be built, dependence on consumer demand and competitive disadvantages relative to conventional businesses. We discuss the implications of our conceptualisation of social entrepreneurship for practitioners, policymakers and future research. © 2017, © 2017 SAGE Publications.},

abstract={Social entrepreneurship is an outstanding phenomenon that links entrepreneurship, social change, and economic development, which increasingly attracts the attention from scholars and policy makers alike. As in any other new venture, including social enterprises, motivated employees and the effect of their teamwork is considered the best way to deliver superior performance in highly competitive, global business environments. Therefore, employees' performance and their commitment become critical factors in the performance of social entrepreneurship. The aim of this article is to, first, explain how social entrepreneurs reinforce employees' commitment by developing some organizational skills (communication, teamwork, delegation, active listening, and attitude). Second, the study carries out a comparative analysis using two types of qualitative comparative analysis (QCA): the crisp set analysis (csQCA) based on the use of dichotomous variables (values 0 and 1); and the fuzzy set analysis (fsQCA) that allows scaling scores of membership intervals between 0 and 1. The sample involved consists of 46 Spanish social entrepreneurs who started-up their companies between 2012 and 2015 and answered a 40 items questionnaire between June and September 2015. After the methodological comparison, the findings reveal that social entrepreneurs can influence employees' commitment through developing the skills of communication, teamwork, delegation, active listening, and attitude. This article's main contribution is setting up the analysis of commitment as a particularly relevant issue in social enterprises due to their social impact. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Social entrepreneurs have, in several ways, been regarded as engines of intense socioeconomic development. They are also famous for intervening with projects for society's problems that are often either inadvertently ignored or inadequately managed by mainstream society. The issue of graduate employability has gained increased tension around the world especially in emerging markets such as South Africa. Currently, suggestions are that considering the avowed contribution of social entrepreneurs, it may be worthwhile to start examining how they can assist with graduate employability in South Africa. This paper, therefore, takes an exploratory yet focused scrutiny of the social entrepreneurship ecosystem to find out the likelihood of social entrepreneurs participating in programs that prepare students for the workplace, thereby reducing graduate unemployability. This is a conceptual paper that has benefitted from an extensive review of literature. Conclusions are drawn therefrom to suggest that opportunities exist for social entrepreneurs to provide practical, project-based learning opportunities for college and university students so that by the time they graduate, they have attained reasonable work-readiness levels that stand them in good stead for employment. While the authors propose an intensive empirical study of the subject matter, we are equally positive that this paper may be used to advance the current platforms of engagement of the role of social entrepreneurs or grow innovative methods that provide graduates with a better chance to be successful in the working environment. In short, this paper calls for sustained discussions on how social entrepreneurs can improve graduate employability. © Faculty of Management, Warsaw University of Technology 2017.},

abstract={The Sport Programme, initiated by municipal administrators and managed by a social entrepreneur, is a Swedish sport-based intervention promoted as a response to social problems of crime and segregation in a targeted urban area. The article examines the manager and coaches’ presentation of the programme with respect to how pedagogical governing techniques are assumed to promote social change and how desirable citizen subjects are constructed for social inclusion. A variety of statements are analysed from a governmentality perspective. It is concluded that, although problems are assumed to be caused by structural segregation, the intervention targets individual change and risk management. Presumably, subjects are provided with motivational powers that are shaped by role models and applied in ‘choosing the right track’, navigating among risks and averting problems and exclusion. By representing problems as risks, avoidance is formed as an individual opportunity. This technology of individual agency is aimed at shaping motivated, responsible and self-governing citizen subjects, thus representing subjects as being responsible for their own welfare and inclusion. With respect to sport as a means of responding to social problems, the article provides reflections on and empirical accounts of the conditions of welfare provision and social work under advanced liberalism. © 2017, © 2017 European Association for Sociology of Sport.},

At the same time, performing on all the three parameters of `triple bottom line'- financial, social and environmental became extremely crucial for the corporate sustainability. In such a changing context, traditional form of CSR seems no longer relevant. The authors emphasize the need of thinking of more innovative models of CSR, so that business benefits and social benefits can be combined in true sense. Few examples of such innovative models of integrating CSR and social entrepreneurship (SE) are discussed in the paper. The authors believe that SE can support CSR, and effectively bridge the gap between business and society. © 2017 SAGE Publications.},

Design/methodology/approach: The qualitative study interrogates both the identity of a diasporic social entrepreneur in an attempt to develop a framework that links this concept to community entrepreneurship using a single case study. Findings: With hindsight, The Global Soap Project has much to offer in terms of “saving lives” in these communities, as the battle against the Ebola virus calls for containment measures. Research limitations/implications: While arguably limited in terms of being a single case, this study furthers the understanding on the role of social entrepreneurship in complementing community efforts and coping strategies for tackling pandemics such as the Ebola virus. Social implications: Evidently, while vaccines are being fast-tracked, the spread of the virus can be curtailed through personal hygiene, and the project illustrates how an individual social enterprise can be leveraged at the community level.

Problematizing social entrepreneurship in terms of the political economy of knowledge and based on Ostromian polycentricity and Hayekian knowledge, we first find the main strength of social entrepreneurship is that local, decentralized social entrepreneurs usually are the most appropriate and best-positioned—indeed, the most efficient—actors to solve their communities’ social problems. Also based on the work of the Ostroms and Hayek, we identify the main weakness of social entrepreneurship: the lack of institutional safeguards to social entrepreneurship. The localized decision-making process, however, might mitigate to some degree the potential for large-scale abuse. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.},

As a result, an organizational field that was traditionally based on the logic of gift giving increasingly rejects the idea of an unconditional distribution of goods and embraces the rationales, techniques and language of markets. This development, known as the ‘marketization’ of the third sector, is characterized by a heightened emphasis on competition and earned income, the celebration of (social) entrepreneurship and the emergence of new actors, such as for-profit providers and donors (Salamon, 1993; Weisbrod, 1998; Eikenberry and Kluver, 2004). © 2015 selection and editorial material, Ekkehard Thümler.},

abstract={In recent years, civil society organisations in China have increasingly taken entrepreneurial and innovative approaches to enhance their ability to fulfil social missions. How are we to delineate the salient characteristics of non-profits engaging in socially entrepreneurial activities in comparison with their conventional counterparts? Will the emergence of social entrepreneurship in China's non-profit sector engender new opportunities for grassroots social organisations to overcome the financial and institutional impediments constraining their development? This article tackles these issues through an in-depth case study of a typical social entrepreneurship initiative launched in the process of post-disaster construction after the 5.12 Wenchuan Earthquake in 2008. The findings indicate that socially entrepreneurial non-profits participate in post-disaster reconstruction more innovatively than conventional non-profits in various ways. Nevertheless, they still need to conquer organisational and contextual challenges before evolving into an effective remedy to the development pains of grassroots social organisations in China.},

We argue that not only are SEVs complex systems, but also operate as a SoS. As such, SEVs could greatly benefit from a general systemic risk management approach that is often applied to SoS. In order to explain our position, we consider an example of an existing SEV and apply these concepts totheir operations. We also identify systemic risksin the example and show how the application of a systemic risk management approach can benefit SEVs.},

abstract={In frontier economies, social entrepreneurship has emerged as a successful strategy to pursue sustainable development goals. By creatively blending business strategy, technology innovation and a deep understanding of customer need, social enterprises provide a pathway out of poverty, an alternative to private charity and government aid. Social entrepreneurs are developing strategies to make available distributed energy products, clean cooking and clean water technologies, and sustainable livelihoods. Social entrepreneurship is a pro-poor economic development strategy that promotes the common good. Many social entrepreneurs describe their work with terms like “calling” or “moral purpose” or “vocation,” harkening the emphasis in the Ignatian spiritual exercises on “making an election.” Launched in 2003, the Global Social Benefit Institute (GSBI®), at Santa Clara University was and is a pioneer in the field of social enterprise capacity development. Originally conceived as a social enterprise incubator, GSBI now offers a diversified portfolio of programs. The GSBI has worked with more than 340 social enterprises. These operate in more than 60 countries, and have raised US$96 million in funding. The GSBI does not deploy explicit religious language, however, its educational philosophy is shaped by Jesuit educational values. It recruits and selects social entrepreneurs who serve the poor, and places them in stage-appropriate programs to help them grow and serve more people. The GSBI provides a structured curriculum combined with customized mentoring by experienced Silicon Valley executives. This follows very closely the notion of cura personalis, the personalized spiritual accompaniment provided by Jesuit spiritual directors, and is consistent with classic Jesuit educational philosophy. This pedagogy of accompaniment provides optimal support for people to make progress toward their divinely gifted potential. Perhaps most important of all, Ignatian spirituality and the social entrepreneurship movement share an inspiring moral imagination. Both are unreasonable in their insistence that more can be done to alleviate the unjust suffering of the poor. The GSBI bridges these two realms, exchanging the inspiration and practical can-do of both social entrepreneurs and Ignatian pedagogy. The social entrepreneurship movement benefits from GSBI’s pedagogical approach, and Jesuit Catholic higher education benefits from collaborating with this practical social justice movement. © Universidad Alberto Hurtado, Facultad de Economía y Negocios.},

abstract={Subject area: Entrepreneurship, Business Strategy. Study level/applicability: The case is designed for business students at the undergraduate or MBA levels in courses that deal with social entrepreneurship. The case describes the future growth potential of the exotic vegetable/fruit market in emerging economy India and lends itself for use in Rural Management courses as well. Case overview: Nisarg Nirman Agro Products Private Limited (hereafter referred as NNPL), a social farming venture, was started by Anjali Churi in the year 1997 in India. Churi, an agriculturist at heart, was always interested in experimenting and conducting research on new crops. What started as a small research experiment soon prospered to become a commercial venture producing and selling exotic vegetables to the Indian business customers, such as the five-/four-star hotels, premier clubs, hypermarkets, etc. NNPL was one among the pioneers to start the cultivation of exotic vegetables in the country. Their indigenous produce was of high quality. Their business customers were benefitted by the freshness of their products as well as competitive pricing as compared to their earlier imports. In her journey to commercial prosperity, she adopted co-operative farming, thus providing employment and livelihood opportunities to Indian farmers. Over the period, NNPL was invited to provide agriculture consulting to some of the other countries, such as Maldives, Thailand and Israel. In 2014, the company boasted of an indigenous produce of 95 different varieties of exotic vegetables and fruits, with 34 clients across the country, revenues to the tune of INR40 million and touching lives of more than 600 farmers across the country. The Indian exotic vegetables market had a promising future. Churi desired to expand her venture but in a manner that could systematically impact and generate employment opportunities for the rural Indians. She was at crossroads to deciding what could be such a venture, agro-processing or agro-tourism? Any such expansions required substantial investments for agricultural research activities. The case is structured to achieve the following pedagogical objectives: a social entrepreneur's ability to identify and exploit the market opportunity for growing own venture as well as generating a larger social impact; understand the industry's change trajectory and its impact on the venture; understand the importance of such business models of cooperative farming in populous emerging economies such as India where 70 per cent of the population resides in rural India. Expected learning outcomes: The case that maps the growth/challenges of a social farming venture and allows students to: understand that small social venture also has the ability to generate a larger social impact; evaluate the venture's strategic positioning and scope in a competitive environment; and evaluate the need and potential of business models as cooperative farming to generate employment at the base of the pyramid in populous emerging economy as India.

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to study how a social venture perceives and constructs its identity. This study highlights the importance of a common cause and collective entrepreneurial identity when studying entrepreneurial cognition in a social entrepreneurship context. The study also introduces the concept of identity layers. These aspects have not been emphasized in previous research and, therefore, there is a lack of knowledge in this specific area. The research question that this paper sets out to explore is “What influences the identity perception of a social venture and how does the identity construction process affect organizational behavior?”. Design/methodology/approach The paper starts by presenting references to previous research in social entrepreneurship, entrepreneurial cognition and organizational identity, thereby building a theoretical context for the case study. The case chosen is the cultural heritage site Rosenlund located in Pietarsaari, Finland. The study is based on qualitative data. Previous research on entrepreneurial identity has often been based on narrative analysis and discourse analysis (Jones et al., 2008; Down and Warren, 2006). To get a different point of view, this analysis concentrates more on behavior and outcomes, but in combination with narratives. The data analysis starts out by mirroring Rosenlund in the categorization of Zahra et al. (2009) and then moves on to taking a closer look at the organizational identity and how it is constructed. Findings The results from the case study show that the identity perception and the identity construction process are strongly affected by the mission (i.e. the cause) of the organization. Due to limited resources, the organization needs to be flexible, but the organization is under no circumstances ready to compromise its values. To avoid this potential dilemma, the organization has created an identity consisting of many layers, where the outer layer is thinner and more inclusive, thus providing the flexibility needed. This way of constructing identity clearly impacts the way the organization works. Research limitations/implications The results indicate that Rosenlund identity-wise perceives itself mainly as a collective actor. The entrepreneurial actions undertaken cannot be assigned to one single actor, but instead to a group of people. This does not rhyme very well with existing entrepreneurial cognition research where the focus is on the person, i.e. individual actor. To get a better understanding of social entrepreneurship, “collective entrepreneurial cognition” therefore needs to be studied. The organization studied turned out to be a social constructionist. It remains for future research to investigate if the same layers of identity can be seen in social bricoleurs and social engineers. Practical implications The results indicate the importance of identifying and communicating mission and values, i.e. defining core identity. Strategic decisions become easier when the organization has clearly defined its cause and its values, because then the organization will know when to compromise and when to say no in order not to jeopardize the cause. In the long run, this will have a positive effect on the organizational development. Originality/value One important finding is the existence of different layers in the organizational identity. This aspect has not been addressed before and can certainly deepen our understanding of social entrepreneurial ventures. Moreover, the findings show that by introducing the concepts of organizational identity and identity building, the focus of the entrepreneurial cognition debate shifts from an individual perspective to a collective perspective. This aspect has not previously been explored in entrepreneurial cognition research. ©Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

The paper discusses the key elements of this theory and highlights the connections to public choice (especially the Virginia School) and new institutional economics (especially the Bloomington School).

We elaborated CityU’s approach to service leadership and showcased how we implemented the framework in two undergraduate courses that embrace the spirit of service learning and social entrepreneurship.

abstract={This paper examines the role of higher education in developing social entrepreneurship in Malaysia. Higher education institutions are social industries. They prepare important social capital for the society. Presently, the concept of social entrepreneurship is becoming popular all over the world. In response to this trend, the higher education has also shifted its attention towards using higher education as a means to promote social entrepreneurship. Few studies have explored this phenomenon. For this purpose, an examination of the existing literature was carried out to find answer to the main question that how higher education institution is responding to the need of development of social entrepreneurship. The findings of the review show that although the concept of social entrepreneurship is still in its infancy stage in Malaysia but it is increasingly gaining attention. Interestingly, the higher education institutions are providing suitable foundation for the development and promotion of social entrepreneurship in the country. However, in this regard, the paper found lack of financial support to higher education institutions for the development of social entrepreneurship. To overcome this situation, the paper suggests that higher education institutions may be used as a suitable platform for promotion of social entrepreneurship. The paper concludes that the future of economic growth and social development of the society is closely connected with the concept of growing social entrepreneurship in the country. On the basis of this review, the paper recommends that there must be a strong political and financial support for the higher education institutions for the promotion of social entrepreneurship. © MCSER-Mediterranean Center of Social and Educational Research.},

abstract={This article reflects the growing interest and significant socio-economic contributions culminating from Community-University Research Partnerships (CURP) across Canada. It is based on a series of in-depth interviews conducted with community and university partners funded by Canada’s Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council. The research partnerships represented various partnership arrangements and thematic sectors reveals the significant value inherent in partnership research in solving community problems, building institutional capacity, new ideas, management of skills and new technologies, while extending current, and new areas of research. These partnerships provide evidence that collaborative learning and action can accomplish much when they are able to pool diverse resources, skills, and forms of creativity. Partnerships also provide important opportunities for students to learn about community problems first hand, while developing leadership, communication, and research skills. The ‘spill-over’ affects ofthese partnerships are substantial, as articulated by those interviewed for this study: in terms of informing policy, leveraging additional funding, the development and maintenance of new projects, and in building strong relationships and social capital between university and community. This research was conducted by the Centre for Public Sector Studies at the University ofVictoria between March and April 2012 using background documents supplemented by interviews with select award holders across Canada representing the various nationally funded partnership arrangements. The projects highlighted took place both in urban and rural settings across various sectors and forms of intervention including building age friendly communities, affordable housing, promotion of the social economy and social entrepreneurship, revitalizing rural economies, adapting information technology for disabled persons, labour research, local food production, and Aboriginal language and culture revitalisation. The authors draw on the emerging concept ofknowledge democracy as a helpful theoretical discourse for understanding community based research and community university research partnerships. Our article further points to a number of emerging trends in Canada in how communities and universities are working together and building a new architecture ofknowledge. These include: creating a more dynamic and relevant curriculum in Higher Education; recognition of the roles of regional, sectoral and national research alliances and networks; increased recognition of partnership research as a measure of academic excellence; and increased recognition of the diversity ofknowledge cultures to be drawn on by communities and the academy when working together. © Rainer Hampp Verlag.},

abstract={This chapter presents a model of innovation in the public elementary schooling system by drawing on ongoing work on an "Educational Innovations Bank" in India, which seeks to make available a freely accessible forum for innovative teachers and a grassroots innovations resource for administrators. How do some teachers in government elementary schools, working in contexts of socioeconomic and educational deprivation, achieve their educational goals in spite of facing the same constraints as thousands of other teachers? What lessons do they offer for policy reform? The answers draw on the social entrepreneurship and workplace innovation literature to first locate the incentive for innovation in the social value that socio-educationally entrepreneurial and innovative behavior of teachers creates. Next, an examination is presented of how this social value leads to learning for an identity of competence, which in turn provides an incentive for further educational innovation. Finally, the evidence is presented to argue for policy entrepreneurship and a formal framework to help in the diffusion, adoption, and adaptation of both the enabling innovations that result from socio-educational entrepreneurship and the in-school or in-class educational innovations. Such a "bottomup," peer-learning-based approach to innovations that also "improve" provides a unique way of visualizing educational reform in resourceconstrained public educational systems.

Los Angeles County, California. Participants. Purposive sample of 14 congregations representing diverse races/ethnicities (African-American, Latino, and white) and faith traditions (Jewish and various Christian). Method. Congregations were recruited based on screening data and consultation of a community advisory board. In each congregation, researchers conducted interviews with clergy and lay leaders (n = 57); administered a congregational questionnaire; observed health activities, worship services, and neighborhood context; and reviewed archival information. Interviews were analyzed by using a qualitative, code-based approach. Results. Congregations' health-related activities tended to be episodic, small in scale, and local in scope. Trust and social capital played important roles in congregations' health initiatives, providing a safe, confidential environment and leveraging resources from-and for-faith-based and secular organizations in their community networks. Congregations also served as ''incubators'' for members to engage in social entrepreneurship. Conclusion. Although the small scale of congregations' health initiatives suggest they may not have the capacity to provide the main infrastructure for service provision, congregations can complement the efforts of health and social providers with their unique strengths. Specifically, congregations are distinctive in their ability to identify unmet local needs, and congregations' position in their communities permit them to network in productive ways.

abstract={Purpose: The study seeks to extend the comprehension in entrepreneurial marketing (EM) and social value creation through searching the entrepreneurship process in the socially valued art industry. Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on a qualitative method: multiple case study. In total, six art-related innovative enterprises are chosen in different categories (art school, museum, art fair, art gallery, art media) in the art industry. Common properties of the cases are; creating social value in different scopes; and being pioneer and changing the rules in their fields as the entrepreneurial marketers. Findings: The result of the case study is based on the comprehensive model of entrepreneurship process and the findings are introduced in sub titles: antecedents of the entrepreneurship process; antecedents of non-profit and for-profit enterprises; ambidextrous entrepreneurship process; and ambidextrous dimensions of social value creation. Research limitations/implications: The study provides a new insight on social value creation and EM literature. Social implications: The art industry is closely related with social value creation and the study is valuable for filling the gaps between art and the entrepreneurship in this context. Originality/value: The study is valuable since it focuses on opportunity-related phases of entrepreneurship and introduces a holistic and process-based model in the context of cognitive and institutional environmental factors. The Ambidextrous Model of Entrepreneurship and Social Value Creation is valuable in order to inspire future researches, especially in EM. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: The aim of this paper is to analyze the compatibility between entrepreneurial and social attitudes. Specifically, it seeks to analyze whether subjects with a more developed economic entrepreneurial attitude exhibit a less social attitude. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology integrates an economic experimental approach with a standard entrepreneurial intention questionnaire to analyze the interaction between entrepreneurial and social self-perceptions and behavior. Findings: There is empirical evidence that experimental entrepreneurial behavior (characterized by detecting an opportunity and accepting risk to take an economic advantage from it in laboratory experiments) reduces the incentive for social behavior. However, this effect does not appear if just self-perceptions instead of experimental behaviors are considered. Research limitations/implications: The social attitude of entrepreneurs may be overestimated in those empirical research studies based only on data obtained from entrepreneurs' answers to hypothetical questions in a survey. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first paper presenting a laboratory experiment to represent the key features of entrepreneurial behavior instead of a case-control analysis to set differences in the experimental behavior of sub-samples of subjects defined in terms of their entrepreneurial motivation or experience. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

The result is a call for more nuanced understandings of the heterogeneous logics of shadow entrepreneurs. Copyright © 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

They shape knowledge and preferences for policy solutions by funding specific kinds of research, driving community development initiatives, and supporting selected forms of social services. Strategic involvement and monitoring of public policy debates and thoughtful responses to policy changes are crucial for them to meet their goals in a changing environment. This is especially important in areas of social welfare in which government is heavily involved. In this chapter we use the case of the 1996 welfare reform legislation to explore the charitable (that is, giving to those in need) and philanthropic (that is, giving to spur innovation and social change) orientations of foundations before, during, and after this major policy change. Comparing how foundations adopted these two roles also sheds light on how foundations leverage their comparative advantages as social entrepreneurs, institution builders, mediators, and risk absorbers in the field of social welfare.1. © 2010 The Brookings Institution.

abstract={In spite of the traditional involvement of Venezuelan lawyers in the country's social, political and economic life (Perez-Perdomo 1981, 1990, 2006) and their historic role as nation builders, social entrepreneurs and power brokers (Gomez 2008, 2009), the practice of law in Venezuela was largely traditional until the early 1990s. Venezuelan lawyers generally used their legal expertise, tools and resources without commitments to an ideological or social cause (Sarat and Scheingold 2001), and did not rely on litigation as a form of “moral activism” (Sarat and Scheingold 1998). Cause lawyering emerged during the postdictatorship transition in other Latin American countries (Meili 2001: 307); in Venezuela, cause lawyering began to develop during a period of political and social instability and gained even more salience during a decade of radical change in Venezuela's social, political, and economic institutions. Specific events in Venezuela during the last twenty years define three different stages in the emergence and transformation of cause lawyering and human rights activism and in the growing involvement of lawyers in the country's political debate. Each of these three stages corresponds to important changes in the conception lawyers have about their role. Each stage also corresponds to changes in the image that other actors have about members of the legal profession and their role in society. The first stage took place between 1958 and 1989, and coincided with the strengthening of democratic institutions after a period of military dictatorships and political instability. © Cambridge University Press 2010.},

abstract={Social entrepreneurship has recently emerged as a vital concept for assessing how business ventures are integrated with the social objective of development organizations. Despite its increasing salience, social entrepreneurship has remained largely under-investigated in the context of the developing world. In this paper, I explore the nature and form of social entrepreneurship, focusing on the non-profit sector in Bangladesh and using BRAC (Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee) in particular as a case in point. The non-profit sector in Bangladesh, particularly the NGO initiatives, have transformed the lives of millions of poor and marginalized people, mostly women. Due to factors like the need for sustainability, several NGOs have increasingly engaged themselves in commercial enterprises. The paper underscores the potential trade-offs between organizational growth and pro-poor orientation that may jeopardize the social objectives of NGOs. © 2010 Canadian Journal of Development Studies,.

abstract={Purpose – This paper sets out to describe several contemporary models of social entrepreneurship, along with the historical context of African nations typically receiving aid. It also seeks to critique three aid/providing sectors – i.e. charity, government, and social entrepreneurship – with benefits and to explore the limits of each. It also aims to explore the perceptions of aid recipients in an East African village to determine their views of social entrepreneurship compared with other types of foreign aid. Design/methodology/approach – Open/ended interviews were conducted with village elders to establish an exploratory research foundation. Findings – In general, village leaders were more favorable to social entrepreneurship efforts because they offered the possibility of self/reliance and sustainability over time. Large government foreign aid largesse rarely reached villagers, so had little effectiveness in relieving their poverty. Research limitations/implications – Several limitations are evident with the case study method used for the research. Future research is necessary to transfer the findings of the study to larger population segments, other organizations, and other national groupings. Expanded research methodologies, based on theoretical development and quantitative methods, will be required to further enhance the findings. Thus, the research is limited in both methodology and sampling population. The efficacy and limitations of various models of social entrepreneurship must also be tested for effectiveness, scope, scale, and sustainability. Comparative research would lend credibility to the findings. Practical implications – The research findings suggest that villagers are generally more positive about local efforts compared with larger government projects, which rarely had a visible, significant impact on the villagers' lives. Leaders and villagers will continue partnerships that develop their businesses with the intention of providing for the social good of the community. Practical programs that develop marketing activities targeted to the specific goal of the business model would be an important step in furthering the goals of each model. For example, developing investment capital markets may require more advertising and promotion to raise awareness of their existence among potential donors. Additionally, local entrepreneurs involved in a social program may benefit from marketing education that enhances knowledge of customer needs and product development. Originality/value – Because of the difficulties in establishing large research programs abroad, as well as in gaining the trust of local populations on a short/term basis, the interviews represent a meaningful first step in understanding perceptions about social entrepreneurship and larger foreign aid programs. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

abstract={In a rapidly changing world, social entrepreneurs innovate and create social value. Social workers today need to redefine their roles to include that of the social entrepreneurs.Social entrepreneurs may be defined as “people with the mission to create and sustain social value. These social change agents are not limited by resources currently at hand but pursue new opportunities to serve people, take calculated risks and engage in a process of continuous social innovation, adaptation and learning. Ultimately, social entrepreneurs have a sense of accountability to the constituencies served and for the outcomes. The social worker’s response to the challenges of the new economic environment and globalisation includes advocating for policies that promote social as well as economic development, social participation, and equality. Implications of entrepreneurship for social work education include training which equips social workers for new challenges and developing curriculum to include new content areas and skills as well as an exposure for a broader knowledge-based economy. The recognition for economics and social connectedness is vital. Conscious effort must also be made to internationalise the social work curriculum and be proactive in initiating faculty and student collaboration, research and exchanges.Social entrepreneurship is a deliberate move from the remedial orientation to developmental activities. The focus should be on enhancing social capital. Social entrepreneurs are the trailblazers to help find new ways toward a better social world. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the motivations of social entrepreneurs in East Africa to create a social enterprise and their identified links to successful social entrepreneurship in East Africa. Design/methodology/approach: The authors employed a qualitative method by performing thematic analysis on a set of interviews on social entrepreneurs from East Africa who are Ashoka fellows. Findings: The findings suggest that intense personal experiences linked to past-life events as well as a high achievement orientation towards improving livelihoods and creating impact serve as key triggers for social entrepreneurship. Successful entrepreneurship focusses on system change at national and local levels. Their success is also seen when the social entrepreneurs have achieved their mission and are no longer needed; thus, they become irrelevant. The paper discusses the implications of these findings on the model used for sustainable social entrepreneurship in East Africa. Practical implications: Based on an exploratory research on Ashoka fellows, the study adds insight to their motivations and success which can be used in a wider scale study of the same. Originality/value: The authors advance the scarce empirical research on East African social entrepreneurs, link success factors of social entrepreneurship to a recent framework on motivation to engage in social entrepreneurship and stimulate further research in the area.

abstract={Purpose: This study explores the influence of sharing achievement (i.e. sustainability, enjoyment, and economic benefits) obtained by participating in the sharing economy on social entrepreneurial intention (SEI), as well as the role of perceived social worth and social entrepreneurial self-efficacy (SESE). Design/methodology/approach: This study used multiple regression analysis on a sample of 331 MBA students aged between 24 and 48 years. Findings: The findings indicate that sharing achievement is positively related with SEI, and perceived social worth mediates the relationship between them. Moreover, SESE not only has a moderating effect on the relationship between perceived social worth and SEI but also positively moderates the overall mediation model. Practical implications: Entrepreneurship educators could focus on improving students' SESE through courses and training. Whereas, policymakers and decision makers should actively promote the sharing economy model and regulate its management. Moreover, existing organizers of the sharing economy should improve participants' sharing achievement. Originality/value: This study determines the relationship between sharing achievement and SEI and enriches the push/pull theory from the perspective of pull factors in the context of the sharing economy. Moreover, by exploring the mediating effect of perceived social worth and the moderating effect of SESE, the study provides understanding on the influence mechanisms of sharing achievements on SEI. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Despite contributing to its legitimacy and relevance, scholars have raised concerns that an economic paradigm may be limiting the future of entrepreneurship research. To address these concerns, we propose religion as an alternative and complementary foundation for our field's economic legacy by allowing for transformative research that embraces multiple perspectives. While religion has been generally neglected by entrepreneurship scholars, it holds great promise because of its prevalence, centrality, established base of scientific inquiry, and ability to provide novel answers to emerging phenomena. We chart a new path for entrepreneurship that integrates religion and the “theological turn” in entrepreneurial processes and contexts and identify a number of key research questions. We believe the theological turn in entrepreneurship research builds on our past legitimacy, creates important possibilities to tackle emerging topics, and challenges us to move beyond our existing knowledge horizons to further advance the field of entrepreneurship. © 2021 The Author(s)},

abstract={The aim of the research is to discuss methodological issues that could be learned from the use of historical terms such as trust and social capital in a rural area. We hope to gain knowledge from discussing these old concepts in a new setting; a mountainous rural area in Greece. The basic hypothesis lies in the fact that social capital can be detected through trustworthy relationships, which, in turn, can nourish social entrepreneurship. The research sought to disclose the dynamics in the area that will then help to form a policy proposal for promoting Social Economy in rural areas. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={This paper addresses a gap in the literature regarding social entrepreneurship education through an exploratory study that leverages three separate, but distinct experiential learning projects. Students were randomly assigned into three separate groups: action-research, service learning, and a ‘traditional’ new social enterprise venture. All three approaches fostered student development and social entrepreneurial skill building. However, experiential learning (action research and service-learning) placed a greater emphasis on student comprehension of the subject matter in relation to the weight of responsibility they experienced by partnering with third-party organisations outside the classroom, compared to the traditional new venture approach. The findings indicate that experiential learning is an optimal conduit to student maturity when coupled with self-reflection and class discussion. The term backpack bootstrapping is introduced to illustrate how students rapidly learn by taking on a real but manageable weight of responsibility they assign to themselves. This study is original for its approach to incorporating student voices to gauge how their learning may be enhanced to improve social entrepreneurship education. Although it is an exploratory study and limited in its scope (26 students over one semester), it provides a basis for further research using experiential learning models in social entrepreneurship education. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

After a review of the academic literature on the role that the student’s reputation plays in community learning and to understand the role of involving the student that new techniques of gamification have taken in virtual learning, an empirical analysis is performed on the basis of data from a pioneer MOOC of Social Entrepreneurship (5016 registered students, 3250 of whom actually started). Using Classification and Regression Trees (CARTs) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), we conclude that social reputation is a key factor for the student in successfully completing the course, and that the student’s retention is, along with his e-reputation (“karma”), directly related to his degree of participation, the rewards received, and his correspondence with peers. This shows that one of the factors that explain the student’s MOOC completion is his degree of interaction with other students, and particularly his reputation among them. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={This article follows a humanistic management approach to analyze how indigenous social enterprises contribute to building sustainable rural communities. To this end, I first explore the process of how these entities were formed and developed the necessary capabilities to generate such outcomes. Then, I examine the strategies indigenous social enterprises create to engage in value creation activities with the community and their main outcomes. Such outcomes are finally classified by the problems they addressed according to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), since one of the gaps in the literature indicates a lack of studies that relate specific SDGs with the outcomes of social enterprises in developing countries. This article follows a qualitative approach, a case study research strategy, and uses semi-structured interviews as the main data collection instrument. Evidence from four cases of indigenous social enterprises in Latin America suggests that these entities originate as a result of a major crisis that affects the dignity of the individuals and compromises the socio-economic dynamics of the communities. Second, local leadership urges a response that takes the form of a social enterprise that follows local principles and governance and pursues dignity protection, sustainability, and cultural reaffirmation. As a result, the communities have increased their levels of well-being and sustainability, linked to SDGs such as good health, decent work, reduced inequalities, public infrastructure, sustainable communities, and partnerships for the goals. This article also sheds light on how a humanistic management approach can contribute to a better understanding of the dynamics of social enterprises, as these humanistic principles and practices seem to be naturally promoted by social entrepreneurs. © 2020 by the author.

abstract={When a socioeconomic crisis arises in an emerging economy, it highlights structural social issues facing the country and disproportionally impacts those from disadvantaged areas. Social entrepreneurship may be important as part of the solution to overcome this situation. However, it is often privileged individuals who engage in social entrepreneurship to tackle the problems of those who are disadvantaged. To enable social entrepreneurship in disadvantaged areas, we argue that it is instrumental to overcome a lack of at least three capitals: economic, human, and social and to craft enabling ecosystems. This rapid response paper explores how intermediary organizations might support and foster social entrepreneurs from disadvantaged areas. We discuss challenges and opportunities drawing on insights from micro and macro level perspectives in the entrepreneurship literature and from the challenges faced by ANIP, an organization which brings together actors from different sectors to develop social entrepreneurship in disadvantaged areas of São Paulo, Brazil. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Previous research separately considers entrepreneurship, environmental quality, or environmental value in the economic development process. This study aims to elucidate the relationship between entrepreneurial activities and environmental load (focusing on CO2) by analyzing global data. Its major contribution is the addition of the entrepreneurship factor in the relationship, not only between entrepreneurship and environment but also among economic development, entrepreneurship, and environment with economic value, by calculating marginal cost. To calculate the marginal cost, the directional distance function is introduced, and the entrepreneurship factor is added to the production function in this calculation. The results show a U-shaped relationship between entrepreneurship and the marginal cost of CO2 emissions in economic development. While an advanced country such as Japan has a median level of marginal cost of CO2, countries such as China, which have low levels of CO2 abatement, have higher rates of entrepreneurial activity. For countries positioned close to the turning point, further promotion of environmental and social entrepreneurship through technological innovation will help achieve greater sustainable progress; this is vital for future sustainable development. © 2020 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland},

To illustrate this argument, the paper makes use of a parable from the New Testament as an example of a religious narrative that can be used to prompt discussions about social entrepreneurs’ ethical dilemmas. The paper adds to the limited works that consider the teaching of ethics within social entrepreneurship education. It also advances studies that seek alternative strategies to teaching ethics in business contexts, making these strategies discernible for discussion within the broader business and management literature. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.},

We develop a multidimensional representation of societal ethics, in that we draw close parallels between the three institutional pillars—normative, cognitive, and regulatory—with three forms of ethics and use this understanding to predict their effects on the demand for and supply of social entrepreneurs. We find that low behavioral ethics (normative ethics) at the societal level provides opportunities for individuals to become social entrepreneurs. Furthermore, while unselfishness (cognitive ethics) motivates individuals to become social entrepreneurs, high public-sector ethics (regulatory ethics) provides the institutional support for such entrepreneurs to thrive. We contribute to cross-cultural comparative entrepreneurship by providing ethical antecedents of social entrepreneurship through a deeper understanding of the influence of ethics as national-level institutions. © 2019 SAGE Publications.},

abstract={Since the 1990s, the socialist higher education system has faced several reforms oriented to satisfy social, economic, and technological demands. However, little is known about the transformation process of the socialist university system over the past two decades. This study provides a better understanding of the entrepreneurial and innovative transition of universities located in socialist economies. By adopting mixed theoretical approaches, we proposed a conceptual model to understand the social, the innovative, and the entrepreneurial transformation of socialist universities. We revised and tested this model in the context of Cuban universities by implementing a prospective case study approach. Our findings show insights about the transition towards a business model innovation within Cuban universities. The determinants have been state regulations, the closing of the complete cycle from teaching to the commercialization of results, and the creation of hybrid structures to manage knowledge. Consequently, the university is facing managerial challenges related to its ability to explore and exploit its activities to generate social, innovative and economic outcomes. Our results provide practical implications for the university managers and actors involved in the transformation process of Cuban universities. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={Over the last decade, the term social innovation has received increased attention as a potential solution to address complex global social problems and to add collective values to society. The forest sector has great potential for fostering employment, community development and reducing increased emigration from rural to urban areas. This potential is not always realised, especially in economically weak and remote rural areas. Hence, this paper tackles the question of how social innovations in forestry are able to succeed under adverse circumstances and contribute to respond to some of the before mentioned challenges? To answer this question, we first identified four very different cases across Europe that are compatible with the criteria of social innovation. Proceeding from this starting point, comparative research was undertaken with the aim to identify the cases' specific features and key criteria for success. In the cases considered, it is evident that the sheer determination and voluntary investment of time and effort by key individuals, who were convinced of the value of the idea for the community, provided indispensable impetus to all four social innovations. In drawing its conclusions, this paper highlights the principal areas that need consideration and that hence have implications when developing supportive policies. Furthermore, we provide some insight into future research topics that would allow us to better understand the positive impacts of social innovation in the forest-based sector. © 2020 by the authors.},

The objective of this research is to explore the development of local business model niches within the scope of circular textiles and fashion, including social enterprises. The research is based on the analysis of a specific territory, the Nouvelle Aquitaine Region in France, where participative observations at different scales (local, regional and interregional) have permitted an in-depth comparison of four local social enterprise business models.

abstract={Urban innovation policies reintroduce the role of social entrepreneurs and civil society into innovation studies with regard to the governance of regional innovation and the emergence of new innovation pathways. The research approach integrates the concepts of urban and regional transformation, participatory governance and works with an actor-centered approach that employs the enactment of innovation models by actor constellations such as the smart city concept and the Triple Helix model. We illustrate the pathway of a citizen-driven approach in innovation for the case of Brainport smart district in the city of Helmond, in the metropolitan high-tech region Eindhoven in The Netherlands. The empirical data is obtained in a real-world laboratory (rwl) in a multi-stakeholder co-creation process. The case contributes to the categorization of citizen-driven innovation pathways within an extended approach of Economic Evolutionary Geography (eeg) and thus to the frame of reference for structural dynamics in social theory. © Christiane Gebhardt, 2019},

abstract={Research on social entrepreneurship still lacks theoretical depth, as well as the analysis of the antecedents that lead to the emergence of social enterprises. Seeking to advance such discussion, this paper aims to analyze if and how the conceptual model for analysis of social entrepreneurship antecedents proposed by Jiao in 2011 is empirically supported. Thus, semi-structured interviews with ten Brazilian social entrepreneurs were conducted. From the results, the existence of a new antecedent not described in the conceptual model developed by Jiao was identified, and a framework for analysis of the antecedents that lead to the emergence of social enterprises is being proposed in this paper. The framework elaborated from cases present in an emerging economy that has several social problems also points to analytical inconsistencies in Jiao’s model. Besides allowing the theoretical advance about the initial stage of social enterprises formation, this paper also contributes presenting relations that help minimize the theoretical misunderstanding about the conceptualization of social entrepreneurship, generating a clarified definition. In addition, an agenda with directions for future research on social enterprises and social entrepreneurship is proposed. © 2020, ANPAD - Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Administracao.

abstract={Why do social entrepreneurs retain their faith in social entrepreneurship despite the organizational tensions and anxieties inherent to this field of practice? In this article, we employ the psychoanalytic concept of fantasy to advance knowledge on social enterprise creation. The research analyses qualitative data relating to the adoption of the Community Interest Company, a bespoke organizational form for social enterprise. We argue that social entrepreneurs adopt a specific organizational form because it represents a fantasmatic object that supports their desire for pro-social work. This fantasmatic form appears to temporarily neutralize tensions and anxieties while preserving attachments to pro-social ideals. Our first contribution is to extant research on the role of fantasy in social enterprise. Specifically, we elucidate how social enterprise creation is riven with fantasy-laden attachments to ideals of pro-social work that promise to counteract concerns about future viability as well as competing social and for-profit missions. Our second contribution is to highlight the role that organizational form choice plays in effectively managing such tensions and anxieties as it provides a robust anchor for pro-social desires. Fantasmatic attachments to pro-social work and organizational form thus emerge as integral to social enterprise creation. © The Author(s) 2019.},

abstract={Purpose: Uncertainty in the early development of digital business startups can benefit from data-driven testing of hypotheses. Startups face uncertainty not only in product development, but also over the structure of the business model and the nature of the customer or market to address. The authors conceptualize a new model, the Lean Discovery Process (LDP), which focuses on market-based testing from the early business idea through to fully realized product stages of an innovation. The purpose of this paper is to highlight a methodology to help digital business reduce uncertainty and apply lean principles as early as possible in the development of a business concept. Design/methodology/approach: Examining literature in lean startups, lean user experience and lean software development, the authors highlight underlying assumptions of existing lean models. The authors then examine the LDP using the case of raiserve, a social entrepreneurship startup that focuses on the management of cause-based voluntary service. Findings: Existing literature focuses on product development against an assumed customer base. Early hypothesis testing can be applied to business concept development to substantially reduce cost and time to market. Research limitations/implications: Further investigation of different forms of uncertainty in digital startups can open up opportunities to further apply lean methodologies. A more extensive empirical study to measure the potential impact is warranted. Originality/value: The authors conceptualize the minimum viable customer and support early testing with concepts from market research and collective intelligence. The authors demonstrate early opportunities to apply lean principles and rigorous hypothesis testing in an LDP that results in significant reductions in time and expense of product development. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

However, previous studies have conceptualized social entrepreneurship based on researches on commercial entrepreneurs. In addition, the scale used in the analysis of social entrepreneurship focuses primarily on behavioral aspects. Although the social and economic values pursued by social enterprises are important virtues for social entrepreneurs, research on the value orientation of social entrepreneurship is insufficient. The essence of a social enterprise is creating social value based on financial sustainability, so the concept of blended value has been recently emphasized. This study analyzed the relationships among blended value orientation, social entrepreneurship, and the performance of social enterprises. The results indicate that the blended value orientation of social entrepreneurs influenced social entrepreneurship and performance; social entrepreneurship fully mediated blended value orientation and performance. These findings suggest that it is important to focus on the blended value orientation of social entrepreneurs and social entrepreneurship in the promotion and policies of social enterprises. © 2019 by the authors.},

Findings: The paper develops a preliminary social enterprise community engagement model (SE-CEM), which results from a broad literature analysis. The proposed model attempts to offer a comprehensive perspective outlining the institutional, organizational, individual, community and process dimensions likely to predict engagement success in SE context. Originality/value: This paper pioneers in presenting a holistic approach to understanding the dimensions that constitute CE in SEs. The SE-CEM incorporates the determinants of CE in social entrepreneurship (S-ENT) context to direct a future research agenda. The preliminary model can further be developed and empirically tested by researchers. Moreover, practitioners can also gain benefits from the model and promote S-ENT. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the business education curricula in South Africa in relation to social entrepreneurship and to ascertain pre-service teachers’ perspectives of the reasons for social entrepreneurship not being included in these curricula as observed in classroom teaching practices. Design/methodology/approach: Through interpretivist inquiry, third-year pre-service teachers’ (n=92) comments on online group blogs were analysed to clarify a range of meanings and understandings of their responses. Findings: Social entrepreneurship as a concept and as an ideal as well as certain fundamental concept is not adequately integrated in the business education curricula in secondary schools in South Africa. Furthermore, the schools where the pre-service teachers conducted their teaching practice were failing to integrate activities associated with social entrepreneurship in their business education curricula. Research limitations/implications: The study was limited to a single tertiary institution. Similar studies in both developing and developed contexts in schools could be initiated as a means of teaching social entrepreneurship for social justice as a subject efficaciously. Practical implications: The study recommends that social entrepreneurship should be implemented earlier in the secondary education system as a means of enhancing the social entrepreneurial capacities of school learners. Originality/value: This is the first study examining the secondary education curricula in a developing economy, such as South Africa, in relation to the absence of the emerging concept of social entrepreneurship. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: This study aims to develop an empirically validated taxonomy. Typologies of social entrepreneurship are primarily based on conceptual considerations and case studies. There is a need for quantitative approaches and empirical testing of this emerging organizational form and its characteristics. Design/methodology/approach: First, an item scale was developed that emerged from frequently mentioned elements in social entrepreneurship literature. Next, social entrepreneurs rated these items. Finally, the authors conducted a cluster analysis to derive a taxonomy with three distinguishable types of social enterprises. Findings: Based on a cluster analysis (N = 70), an empirically validated taxonomy is provided with three social enterprise types: social service providers, social change makers and social philanthropists. Practical implications: Although this research has an exploratory character, it makes a clear contribution by complementing existing typologies, which tend to be conceptual in nature, with a taxonomy that is empirically grounded. This study defogs the blurry understanding and limited knowledge about different social enterprise forms and provides insight into meaningfully similar groups across the sector as a whole. Originality/value: This article fills a void of empirically grounded taxonomies by analyzing which definitional aspects of social entrepreneurship literature correspond to the perceptions of social entrepreneurs regarding the nature of their organizations. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: The paper investigates an unusual form of social enterprising located in a poor region of Pakistan. The purpose of this paper is to examine a novel form of micro social enterprise. Their form and functions are considered, examining how they conform to what is expected of a social enterprise. The extreme cases are analysed to reflect on what constitutes the explanatory characteristics of a social enterprise. Design/methodology/approach: Information on examples of micro social entrepreneurship was collected from the troubled context of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a very poor region of Pakistan. Using the constant comparison method, explanatory themes of structure and practice are drawn out. Findings: These enterprising social agents were engaged in opening up an opportunity space for those disadvantaged by the context. Driven by a strong sense of community responsibility, they drew upon limited, but culturally available resources. Relevance, embeddedness and informality were identified as structural characteristics, and bricolage and effectuation, frugality and social responsibility emerged as practices. Not only did context shape what they did and how they did it, but the purpose of these enterprises was also to help reshape context. From this analysis, it is argued that conceptual concerns should be directed towards behaviours; it should be asked how are enterprises agents of social change, and how are they enterprising? Research limitations/implications: It is argued that a robust indicator for social enterprise is not what they are, but what they do. Consequently, for understanding and theorising, it is suggested that the focus remain on enterprising. This study was limited to unusual cases which may be atypical and ungeneralisable. Nonetheless, the concept – enterprising – may have theoretical applications. Social implications: In reviewing the analysis and findings, it is noted that the proposals in the paper may comprise the early stages of a theory of social entrepreneurship practice. There may be considerable explanatory power in examining the interplays between the agency of social enterprises and the structures that are constituted in the formal and informal institutions with whom they interact. Originality/value: Descriptively, the account draws attention to a possibly neglected phenomenon. Moreover, the extreme cases draw out the significance of a localised practice. Conceptually, there may be value in prioritising practice in social enterprise rather than form and structure. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The topic of the present article presents the size of the social economy sector in Romania and the European Union, highlighting the degree of the social economy concept perception degree among farmers in the north-eastern region of Romania. The research was carried out starting from drawing up a questionnaire, its application and the processing of the obtained data. The Communication from the European Commission on the Social Entrepreneurship Initiative (COM / 2011/0682) defines the main features of social enterprises as the provision of social services and/or goods and services to a vulnerable population, i.e. the professional integration of people with employment difficulties. According to COM/2011, working hypotheses were formulated in line with these elements, which allowed the identification of the degree of connection between the variables underlying their drafting: The age of respondents, the socially vulnerable people employment policy, the field of activity, the social responsibility area, the acceptability degree of agricultural social cooperatives, the development of local communities. The results of the research revealed a strong association between the analysed variables, validating the proposed assumptions. © 2019, Vilnius University. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Reuse is a type of concept meant to solve environmental problems and can be implemented in different models. This study explores the social franchising model in the area of ICT reuse, relying on a case study of international social franchise and a comparative analysis of its three franchisees. The concept of the proposed social franchising model is based on a theoretical framework and a case study organization analysis, and has four developmental phases with nine identified key factors, which are essential to creating the necessary systematic approach for a successful outcome by creating both economic and social impact on a scale. This article contributes to the social entrepreneurship literature by analyzing success factors that have allowed our case study to operate as a highly successful franchise. The empirical part of the paper employs a case study of the organization to provide evidence of the existing model for social franchising in the reuse of ICT in Ireland, the U.S. and Slovenia. The paper concludes by revealing the social franchising model framework in the reuse of ICT. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={Currently, the development dynamics of the market and socio-economic relations require creating hybrid forms of organizations, able to fill the market niches and to intervene when the state cannot fulfill its obligations. In this sense, social entrepreneurship is a popular term that encompasses a wide range of structures and organizations, running the business in order to achieve certain social impact. It should be understood that social entrepreneurship is not a project, but business, business of dual nature: entrepreneurship with strong social impact. The stages of development of the theoretical approaches to social entrepreneurship are presented in this article. Some issues of the formation of social entrepreneurship in Kazakhstan are considered. The main obstacles to the development of social entrepreneurship in Kazakhstan are the disparity of information on social entrepreneurship, the lack of consulting services, criteria and support mechanisms, public information on state tenders and contact details. Meanwhile, the development of social entrepreneurship in Kazakhstan is becoming an important activity for all stakeholders - the entrepreneurs, the state, and the society. Social entrepreneurs can become reliable partners of the state in solving the social problems in the country. They will be able to solve the social problems of the population in a qualitative way, simultaneously saving the budget funds allocated for the social sphere. © 2018. ASERS Publishing.

abstract={The economic crisis has called the current economic models into ques- tion, emerging new ways of understanding the role that companies play in society. As the proliferation of academic articles shows, social innovation and entrepreneur- ship are currently playing a relevant role as an instrument for satisfying social needs from the business field, adding social utility to the technical and financial viability of companies. Due to the increasing interest in the social economy, the main objec- tive of this chapter was to conduct a study of the scientific production related to innovation and social entrepreneurship, using for this purpose bibliometric tech- niques and the longitudinal statistical analysis of articles published in journals indexed in the multidisciplinary database Scopus (Elsevier) up to the year 2016. Thus, through an advanced search for terms, more than 1400 documents were obtained, of which 791 articles were selected to make up the ad-hoc database, which the analysis is based on. As a result, it is concluded that since 2006, there has been a considerable increase in the number of studies that address the social economy from different areas of knowledge, standing out from the rest Business, Management and Accounting, Social Sciences and Economics, Econometrics and Finance, studies which are published in a limited number of specialized journals by authors from countries such as the United States, United Kingdom, Spain or Canada. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

abstract={As hybrid organizations with financial and social objectives, social enterprises must balance competing logics for governance, stakeholders, and outcomes when considering organizational design and structure. The existing legal landscape for organizations exacerbates this dilemma by forcing social enterprises to incorporate as either a nonprofit or for-profit organization. This research examines the entity formation process for social enterprises by presenting sector choice as an interaction among four factors: equity financing, organizational lineage, human capital, and funding environment. Using a qualitative comparative case analysis, this research demonstrates that contingent factors drive sector choice when legal incentives and institutional pressures are unclear. For those choosing nonprofit forms, the status of the parent organization—the organizational lineage—is determinative. For those operating in the for-profit context, human capital is predictive. The resulting conceptual framework contributes to existing organizational theory on hybrid organizations by presenting the sector selection process as independent of the motives or legal incentives typically associated with sector choice. This research concludes with a discussion on the advantages of delaying the formal sector declaration process. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Purpose: Design thinking is attracting practitioners and researchers in various walks of life. User integration principle as part of design thinking is expected to transform product and service creation and delivery. Accordingly, various organisations that venture into design thinking develop customised solutions and serve people’s needs. Social enterprises, which are familiar for their superior social value creation, have also claimed to embark upon this innovative approach to address wicked problems. The current paper makes an attempt to analyse various social and organisational processes that promote social enterprises to adopt design thinking to create products, which are relevant and viable among user groups. This paper finds that by adopting design thinking, social enterprises portray their product innovation genre, thereby representing their passion in addressing wicked problems more effectively. Design/methodology/approach: This research adopts a qualitative case study method to understand the practice of design thinking in social enterprises. Findings: In this study, it is found that that social enterprises adopt design thinking as a methodology while exploring solutions for stubborn problem space. However, neither communities nor social entrepreneurial teams are aware that they are carrying out design thinking practices. This research finds that social entrepreneurs and their teams take up designer roles and carry out designing processes by continuously consulting with user groups. One of the major reasons for the unintended adoption of design thinking is related to community integration and user participation in the day-to-day practices of social enterprises. Originality/value: This study offers original research to understand social entrepreneurial exploration to adopt design thinking to create social value. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Social entrepreneurship is a well-integrated social movement which is composed of business and non-profit sectors. In Thai society, social entrepreneurs still lack competencies to certify practices. Therefore, this research aimed to: 1) explain motivation and social entrepreneur attributes and 2) assess the social entrepreneur competencies of activists with regard to children and youths in Nan province, Thailand. Thirty-two social activists who actively worked on children and youth issues in Nan province were purposely selected from 35 social organizations active with children and youths. Data were collected using both qualitative and quantitative approaches. An in-depth interview using semi-structured questioning was conducted to explain social activists’ motivation. Social entrepreneur attributes and social entrepreneur competencies were assessed using a self-assessment questionnaire. The findings showed that participant's motivation was derived from: 1) beliefs in human dignity and rights, 2) experiences with a role model, 3) own experiences, and 4) gratitude to the nation. Regarding emotional intelligence and social skills, 59.4 percent of participants perceived having a high performance level in understanding emotional conditions when interacting with others and 84.4 percent perceived their ability to adapt and coordinate with others at a high level. On virtues and ethical issues, 96.9 percent viewed these two as significant and necessary for social entrepreneurs. Regarding social entrepreneur competencies, the average score for overall competency was at the master level (X¯=2.76, SD = 0.54). The competency with the highest average score was learning (X¯=3.01, SD = 0.62) followed by teamwork (X ¯=3.00, SD = 0.61). The competency with the lowest average score was fund raising at the apply level (X¯=2.34, SD = 0.73). Thus, a competency development model should be appropriately designed to increase social activist ability. Competency assessment should also be used to assess social activists in order to promote them to be effective social entrepreneurs. © 2017 Kasetsart University},

abstract={The principal characteristic of social entrepreneurship is the creation of businesses with the objectives of solving social issues and generating positive impacts in the community. In recent years there has been an increase in the literature addressing these types of businesses, although the number of works dealing specifically with how they are funded is quite limited, and even more so in the case of those which focus on alternative financing options such as crowdfunding. Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to assess the use of crowdfunding as a source of finance for social enterprises. Specifically, the paper analyzes social entrepreneurs' perceptions of crowdfunding, the reasons that drive or impede its use, the different information available, and its suitability for social enterprises. A study is carried out on social entrepreneurs in Spain using the Delphi method, especially recommended as a methodology for exploratory studies such as this. The results show that crowdfunding as a means of financing is still relatively unknown and little used by social entrepreneurs, and the analysis explains why this is so.},

Successful social innovation, however, was the result of the creation of an organization structured to include diverse stakeholder input and participation in the decision-making process. Thus, compassion motivates entrepreneurs to pursue broad gains as opposed to singular interests and enhances a willingness to incorporate others' ideas through an open-strategy process. Our study suggests that interaction with stakeholders can impact the structure of the firm, the business model it employs, and intended and unintended business consequences. © Published by DigitalCommons@SHU, 2017.},

abstract={Defining social entrepreneurship has found to be a daunting task for many scholars over the last 20 years. Yet this is important, both due to scholarship requirements, and because the social entrepreneur faces the ongoing challenge of validating his or her vision and purpose both to business and to society. This relatively new entrepreneur must be able to define, assess and deliver value in contrast to the traditional economic performance expected of business entrepreneurs. This value is most often termed social value, or social wealth. Sustainable entrepreneurship, environmental and eco-preneurship are even newer concepts, which also struggle to find a proper definition. Why such difficulty? We believe it boils down to clearly defining entrepreneurship and social value. The aim of this paper is to provide clarity in these two primary areas of confusion. To do this, we will bring the insights from the most quoted author on the issue, the late Gregory Dees, and the undisputed foremost scholar in the field of entrepreneurship, Joseph Schumpeter. With Schumpeter's help, we end up offering a non-solution, one that questions the tradition within social entrepreneurship, which is the only one Schumpeter has to offer. © Copyright 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

We analyze programs in each of the four nations and interview data from non-governmental organizers, local journalists, a social entrepreneur in India, one program manager who worked both in Vietnam and Thailand, and one strategic planner. While the programs we examine in this study are relatively new, and thus their long-term effects are as yet unknowable, our preliminary findings indicate that through technology and innovation, practical skills enhancements, and connections with local non-governmental organizations (NGO)-centered CCA projects, women have the potential to increase their political involvement and social status within their communities. While these experiences should provide women with more skills to enhance their social status, multiple structural factors in the regions on which we focused may impede women's political participation. We find that work-around strategies introduced in CCA programs may enable women to achieve greater autonomy. Correspondingly, NGO programs and interventions should be more successful when the state officially acknowledges gender equality and women's rights.},

abstract={A paradigmatic shift around the central role of ‘social entrepreneurs’ is captivating a broad, diverse range of social actors refashioning the institutional landscape of human rights and humanitarian practices. For this special issue dedicated to ‘Re-imagining Human Rights’, we explore some of the implications of these revolutionary changes in human rights practices, and their consequences for sociological study and political critique in the 21st century. Following a discussion of the state of the sociology of human rights practices, we describe the remaking of the human rights arena into a site of technocratic organizations with an emphasis on the ‘triple bottom line’ (financial, social and environmental sustainability). This market-led rights paradigm also promotes a new kind of empathy required for social problem-solving and humanitarian action – one less sentimental, much more technocratic and managerial. We offer some critical observations on this ‘smart humanitarianism’, which emphasizes the human-machine partnership via online technologies, apps, and expert systems management strategies; they redistribute the cognitive responsibilities of determining and delivering goods for greatest measurable impact with a quid-pro-quo of reframing inequality. We introduce the other contributing articles, signposting notable elements and the implications for wider socio-political critique, especially regarding ‘smart humanitarianism’. © The Author(s) 2016.},

abstract={When the Coalition government’s ‘rehabilitation revolution’ was first articulated, innovation was an important theme, encompassing innovation by frontline staff, by organisations working within a mixed economy and even social entrepreneurs. Under Transforming Rehabilitation, innovation remained a stated aim of criminal justice reform, but the scope of innovation envisaged seemed to narrow. This paper describes the early stages of a socially innovative project to develop and implement a personalised approach to offender rehabilitation in the context of Transforming Rehabilitation. It draws on the concept of ‘desistance’. This in turn leads to consideration of community capacity-building and market development that draws on experience from the social care sector. A number of early challenges and plans to overcome them are discussed. Challenges include the inherent uncertainty of the innovation process; the importance of collaborating with a wide range of stakeholders, including service users and local community organisations; innovating during a period of organisational change and wider public sector cuts; and the public presentation of personalised working with offenders. Plans to address these challenges include moving gradually from small-scale prototyping to larger pilots and close collaboration between service providers and evaluators. © The Author(s) 2016.},

abstract={Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the understanding of the factors that influence social entrepreneurial ventures’ (SEVs) pursuit of a blended value approach. This paper predicts and examines that the mindset of SEV senior decision-makers leads them to perceive organisational goals differently. Design/methodology/approach – This paper tests the hypotheses on an original data set of 171 SEVs by means of discriminant analysis. Findings – The results suggest that social entrepreneurs who display an agency-oriented mindset tend to perceive organisational goals as being single: either social or financial. Conversely, social entrepreneurs who have a stewardship-oriented mindset tend to perceive organisational goals as blending both. The findings also underline that senior decision-makers’ mindsets in terms of governance are far from being uniform in SEVs. Research limitations/implications – The findings empirically contribute to the argument that agency principles do apply to broader contexts than profit-oriented organisations (Wiseman et al., 2012) and frame SEVs as a promising context that redefines principal-agent relationships. It follows that the expected association between non-economic goals and stewardship put forward in the literature needs to be nuanced: only a blended value approach of social and financial objectives is associated with stewardship, whereas single social goals are best perceived by agency-oriented senior decision-makers. The results are limited to a single survey, using cross-sectional data. Practical implications – The findings have a bearing on goal setting in social entrepreneurship. The results suggest that practitioners who display a stewardship mindset are more likely to perceive a double bottom line than those displaying an agency mindset. Originality/value – A novel feature of the model is the incorporation of senior decision-makers’ heterogeneous “governance mindsets” (agency and stewardship) and one of the first empirical tests of blended value in social entrepreneurship. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

We find that SE identity work is constructed at both the organizational level and at the level of SE as a whole field or sector. Our contributions highlight the tensions brought about in communicatively constructing identity at multiple levels, and the need for further strategic communication scholarship that critiques identity work as arguments for a vision for social change agendas. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Globally, corporate social responsibility (CSR) is perceived as an important vehicle for building a brand or reputation. Given the link between profitability and reputation, it is expected that CSR will drive profitability up. It is within this context that firms operating in Ghana carry out their CSR initiatives. In Ghana, CSR initiatives are essentially viewed as the strategic decisions taken by organizations to voluntarily tackle the social conditions which have the potential of hampering the accomplishment of their corporate goals. Thus, CSR constitutes non-governmental interventions for addressing some of the developmental challenges that the country faces. Principally, most CSR initiatives, in terms of frequency and magnitude of social investments, are performed by the telecommunication companies, banking institutions, and companies in the extractive industries such as mining and oil and gas. Firms that engage in CSR initiatives in Ghana tend to be foreign-owned. Owing to the current developmental issues, CSR initiatives tend to focus on education, health, environment, social entrepreneurship, and sports development. Thus, visible CSR initiatives can be found in education, mining communities, sports, and coastal communities near the offshore oil and gas production facilities. However, there is paucity of empirical evidence on the relationship between CSR and corporate financial performance in the Ghanaian context. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract={Purpose - This chapter emphasizes the importance of potential and realized capabilities in building and sustaining social innovations. We present an assessment of the drivers and barriers to the development of social innovation ecosystems through the use of internal (absorptive capacities) and external organizational capabilities (open social innovation). A particular emphasis is placed on social innovation outcomes and impacts. The capability approach is particularly useful for measuring social innovation impacts and investigating the "micro-meso-macro" of linkages that underlie the process of social innovation. Methodology/approach - Our methodological approach measures social innovations' outcomes and impact through an aggregative model, which takes into consideration different forms of capabilities that are engendered in the process of or as a result of social innovation. This methodology highlights the importance of social innovation drivers and contexts in which knowledge exploration and exploitation lead to the creation of capabilities that help social innovators to respond to unfulfilled social needs. Findings - The research presented in this chapter provides a new perspective on how the capability approach can be used to assess and measure individual and collective actions when facing social challenges. Research implications - Our research supports and complements the findings of the EU project SIMPACT an acronym for "Boosting the Impact of SI in Europe through Economic Underpinnings," by highlighting the processes and outcomes and SI impact measurement. Social - The measurement of social innovation outcomes and impact has gained importance for policy makers and constitutes a strategic tool for designing policies in support of social entrepreneurs, social investors, and private and public organizations which participate in cocreating and implementing innovative projects. Originality/value - The research presented in this chapter sheds light on the "micro-meso-macro" linkages that foster social innovation ecosystems, and offer valuable tools and guidelines to researchers, practitioners, and policymaker in the field of innovation in general and social innovation in particular.

abstract={How can social entrepreneurs across the globe ensure their long-term viability and impact? Researchers argue that the key to sustainability is demonstrating enduring results, i.e., an ongoing social value proposition delivered with fiscal responsibility. Financial audits aside, this belief implies a need for a temporally-based, social value measurement system. A review of the literature on performance measurement systems in general, and social value measurement in particular, yields a wide range of results and few conclusions, other than that the measurement of social value is challenging but useful. A cross-case comparison of four organizations tests a model proposed for the measurement of long-term impact. The dimensions encompass the externalities of the social value delivered by these enterprises as well as the fiscal foundation for its sustainability. Implications for application and further research about this theory-building and multi-dimensional and global approach are discussed. © 2016 by Jordan Whitney Enterprises, Inc, USA.},

This gap can be addressed through a very practical path of commercialization. However, the path from a technological innovation to a commercially viable product is fraught with challenges. These challenges can be mitigated through small business funding agencies, which are, more and more, catalyzing the dissemination of innovation by fostering social entrepreneurship through capital support and venture philanthropy. This letter describes the differences and nature of these agencies, and their importance in facilitating the translational and real-world impact of technological and scientific discoveries. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={This chapter focuses on the smallholder outgrower model for Jatropha biofuel cultivation in Tanzania. This model is based on seed production by small farmers who sell to a processing company that presses the bio-oil from the seeds locally, either for the local market or for export. This model has been implemented by a foreign investor in Tanzania; the social business model aims at combining profit making with social and environmental objectives. This chapter describes the trends and developments of this innovative business model in a global cultivation, production and usage chain, exploring the trade-offs between the people, planet, profit objectives (triple P) and how the business model adapts to survive through the different stages of the innovation process. The three stages in the innovation process, also described in learning theories are: (1) learning to be effective, (2) learning to be efficient and (3) learning to expand (up-scaling and diffusion). The observed trend is that in the different stages different roles are played by the company as it aims at shifting from subsidy funds to profit making. In the process of becoming efficient and starting to upscale, it seems harder to ensure the implementation of the social and environmental objectives. Therefore, public actors will have to play a more active role in capacity building and market regulation, and additional funding has to be made available for ensuring the social and environmental benefits. New innovations in governance and new ways of linking actors may be part of the solution. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={Purpose: Social entrepreneurship emphasizes on the social value creation through adoption of market-like behaviors. This study aims to explore the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation (EO) and two independent variables comprise of locus of control and world view among those involve in social entrepreneurial venture in Malaysia. Design/Method/Approach: Self-administered questionnaires had been distributed to 87 natural farming participants in Pulau Banggi Sabah and Batang Lupar Sarawak. The questionnaire consists of 4 sections aimed to measure studied variables comprise of the benefit of project, entrepreneurial orientation, locus of control and worldview. Findings: The cross tabulation analysis shows that participants with the open world of view have demonstrated a higher entrepreneurial orientation (EO); while the closed-group demonstrates lower entrepreneurial orientation (EO). Furthermore, the analysis also shows that participants with external locus of control demonstrate higher EO as opposed to the internal locus of control group. The Spearman correlation analysis also indicates a significant association between EO and locus of control [r=0. 473, p= 0.00] as well as EO and world view [r= 0.552, p=0. 00]. Such results indicate that social entrepreneurs must possess high locus of control and opened-world view as both determine the existence of EO in social entrepreneurial endeavors. Originality/Value: The originality of this study lies in its attempt to explore the individual factors that potentially influence the effectiveness and variation in social entrepreneurial projects. Besides, the most important contribution of this study is to incorporate EO variable into social entrepreneur research context. © 2015 Mediterranean Center of Social and Educational Research.

abstract={The objective of this paper is to investigate the role of social entrepreneurship as driver of exaptation. Exaptation is defined as the redeployment of an existing body of knowledge into a new and previously unrelated domain of application and as major source of disruptive innovation and firms’ dynamic capabilities. Exaptation takes place in two phases. In the first phase, the accumulation of knowledge takes place without any anticipation of its future use. In the second phase, the knowledge accumulated is explicitly and consciously leveraged and exploited to build up and take advantage of the opportunity in an emerging market niche. We contribute to extant literature by showing how social entrepreneurship may help firms to discover new potential and innovative field of application for their existing know-how and exploiting it into such a field. Our results are based on a case study of exaptation led by social entrepreneurship in the industrial district of Lumezzane. © 2014 ICCR Foundation.},

Crucial to the efficacy of these value chains is a capable value chain coordinator (VCC). The literature to date focuses on the value chain itself, and less so on its coordinator. In this paper, we utilize the insights of a focus group of rural wealth-creating value chain participants to identify both the roles played by VCCs and the skills required to perform those roles effectively. Our findings expand upon existing knowledge about the VCCs’ roles, and venture into new territory by cataloging requisite skills. We argue that the work of wealth-creating VCCs is best characterized as social entrepreneurship. This work has implications for enhancing the efficacy and sustainability of wealth-creating value chains. © 2014, © 2014 Community Development Society.},

abstract={Purpose: Several studies have investigated the factors affecting innovation in medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) at different levels. However, research into the characteristics of the entrepreneur (individual level) in social economy enterprises (SEE), and the relationship to innovation is scarce. The purpose of this paper is to build upon previous innovation literature to analyse SEE innovativeness. Design/methodology/approach: This paper empirically analyses data from 193 face-to-face interviews with the founder/owner/managing director of small (zero to nine employees) SEE in Andalucía, Spain. A semi-structured questionnaire was produced using the literature review. To ensure the reliability of the data collection and the consistency of the results, several researchers reviewed the codification and analysis of the answers. Quantitative analyses were performed on the data, including descriptive statistical analysis and multivariate analysis (factorial for innovativeness construct validation, multiple regression, cluster, and discriminant). The software SPSS IBM PASSW Statistics 18 was used. Findings: Considering the individual factors, it was determined that a proactive attitude towards innovation and a degree-level education were positively related to SEE innovativeness and that these were the most significant factors considered. The identification of attitude towards innovation was perhaps not surprising; one might expect a relationship between proactiveness and innovativeness. Furthermore, this result is consistent with the positive impact exerted by entrepreneurial characteristics, such as entrepreneurial confidence and adaptability, or SME entrepreneurs’ proactive personality and prospector strategy orientation towards their firms’ innovation. Research limitations/implications: This study has a number of limitations. First, the study is an exploratory study of innovativeness in SEE in a limited geographical area. Second, the fact that the interviews were conducted using a semi-structured questionnaire limited the opportunities for obtaining more detailed information regarding the factors affecting innovativeness in SEE. Third, other variables may have been used as control variables, such as firm age. Sector was used as control variable and it was found as not significant. Fourth, other statistical analyses, such as hierarchical linear modelling, would benefit the results, as different levels of analysis would be considered simultaneously. Fifth, other components of entrepreneurial orientation would render the results more complete. Practical implications: The research findings suggest that SEE would benefit from degree-level people with proactive attitudes towards innovation. Clearly, attitude and education are important aspects of the individual’s mindset. This study demonstrates that the mind sets of the owners of SEE, in terms of both education and attitude, positively impact innovativeness. At least in SEE, degree-level entrepreneurs with positive attitudes towards innovation run more innovative firms. The challenge for regional policy makers is to look beyond the formal education system to promote innovation skills programmes for social and economic impact. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the entrepreneurship and innovation literature by identifying the importance of developing individual-level skills as well as formal education in order to foster innovation in SEEs. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose-The purpose of this paper is to offer new reflection upon the contested interaction of social enterprises with the public sector. It does this by fore fronting the notions of boundaries, boundary work and boundary objects. Design/methodology/approach-The paper reports qualitative research with social enterprise practitioners (from social enterprises and support agencies) in the north of England. Accounts elicited through interviews are combined with visual data in the form of pencil drawings made by practitioners when the authors invited them to respond to and rework diagrammatic models from the literature about the social and economic dimensions of social enterprise. Findings-Participants explained in words and images how normative images of social enterprise depicting linear and static boundaries inadequately represent the complexity of ideas and interactions in their world. Rather, they perceived an iterative process of crossing and re-crossing boundaries, with identities and practices which appeared to shift over time in relation to different priorities. Research limitations/implications-Through participant generated visual data in which social enterprise practitioners literally redrew models from the literature, the paper open space to show movement, transgression and change. Originality/value-This paper is timely as social enterprises are becoming increasingly prominent in the welfare mix. The authors make novel use of conversations and drawings in order to better understand the dynamic and everyday practices of social enterprise within public services. In doing this, the authors also potentially contribute to richer methodological resources for researching the movement of services between sectors. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

For just 15 dollars, he can purchase a mosquito net and quinine from local sources to help prevent one more case of malaria in this village, a disease much less costly to prevent than treat (Medical Aid, 2012). Johannes and his wife Sydney live in Berlin, Germany. Once they’ve completed the Earthship Academy education program in Taos, New Mexico, they plan to create a free online documentary on how to build self-sustainable homes. A small amount of capital will enable them to share their knowhow with others in an effort to mitigate the housing crisis in developing countries (Let Us Be Human, 2012). Elif and Johannes are from different parts of the world, and have different social missions, yet chose the same emerging source of potential funding for their ventures. Like thousands of traditional and social entrepreneurs throughout the world, they’ve turned to crowdfunding as a means of securing the financial capital needed to pursue their missions. No longer constrained by geo-political borders or restricted to government and philanthropy, crowdfunding is one of a growing number of potential funding sources available to social entrepreneurs. © Phillip H.

abstract={Introducing a technology push to stimulate entrepreneurship in remote areas in developing countries can be examined in the context of a franchising model (social or commercial franchising). The results of this study (fieldwork in Kalimantan, Indonesia) point to a high feasibility of introducing a technology push by a franchising model. The results indicate that the smallholder rubber farmers (community level) and the head of villages, head of district and the government departments (low, middle and high institutional level) support a technology push and are willing to participate. Furthermore almost all stakeholders prefer a franchising model to introduce a technology push with social franchising elements. Additionally, empirical evidence confirmed the main theoretical argument of this research: a technology push carried out by a franchising model can stimulate (social) entrepreneurship in remote villages. This study thus concluded that in order to stimulate (social) entrepreneurship in local communities and with that local economic development, a hybrid franchising (a combination of both commercial and social franchising) model should be used to carry a technology push.

abstract={This paper focuses on the ethical frameworks of social enterprises, out of two basic organizational documents which are unveiling the corporate moral discourse (codes of ethics and values statements). Three types of well-known social entreprises have been chosen: (1) charitable clubs and associations; (2) cooperatives and mutuals; (3) conventional private sector foundations. The main contribution of the article is to present the basic connections between social enterprises'moral discourses and some philosophical schools of thought. The paper show how the moral discourse of social entreprises is more or less philosophically coherent. Rational coherence could be applied to values (axiological coherence), or to the philosophical grounds of the discourse (philosophical coherence). The ethical framework of social entreprises is conveying business concerns as well as socially-focused and philosophically-rooted concerns. It is both enhancing economic (business-focused) and non-economic (social) aims. The philosophical challenge of social entreprises is to build up sense of collective identity, without having an ambiguous moral discourse. The moral discourse of social entreprises should have an inner coherence: the various documents (such as the code of ethics and the values statement) should enhance the same set of values. Moreover, if social entrepreneurs are unable to provide a basic philosophical orientation to their corporate moral discourse, then they will not contribute to any social change, since their moral discourse will not be trusted by anyone who is carefully reading the main organizational sources of corporate moral discourse. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

In this paper, we attempt to advance social entrepreneurship theoretically by examining it conceptually, from a 'theory of the firm' perspective. If social entrepreneurship entails pursuit of a double bottom line (Dees, Harvard Business Review, 76 (1), 54-67, 1998), the added complexity of the social entrepreneurial venture identified by Tracey and Phillips (Academy of Management Learning & Education, 6, 264-71, 2007) should be discoverable from a 'theory of the firm' perspective. Applying the knowledge-based theory of the firm to social entrepreneurship, we aver that social entrepreneurship's added complexity is manifest when social entrepreneurial ventures make decisions about protecting their knowledge. Social entrepreneurial ventures manifest this added complexity in all three ways Tracey and Phillips identify: managing accountability, managing identity, and managing the double bottom line. In contrast to ordinary entrepreneurial ventures, social entrepreneurial ventures have to balance two incommensurable objectives when they make decisions about protection of their knowledge. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

This hopeful, difference-making purpose that created meaning in their work and sustained their efforts is characteristic of "spirituality" as encompassed by both secular and non-secular traditions. We suggest that moral imagination, systems understanding, and aesthetic sensibility undergird the spirituality of these difference makers. Further, we elaborate on the specific practices that these difference makers engaged in to create the "spiritual spaces," or retreats, in which personal sustenance, meaning, and connection were generated, hurdles were overcome, and where inspiration and wisdom emerged. The experience of these social entrepreneurs provides an actionable model for all of us to innovate and solve problems in our everyday lives and for the benefit of humanity by carving out personal retreats that enable us to access and leverage our own spiritual resources. © 2013.

Secondly, the general features of the entrepreneurial activity boosted by the global economic system are studied and, later, it is explained how a specific kind of entrepreneurship, such as social entrepreneurship, can promote a change in the current economic paradigm to build a fairer global economic system. Lately, based on data from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor about entrepreneurial activity in the world, an empirical analysis is carried out in order to show some existing differences between market entrepreneurship and social entrepreneurship. The final aims of this work are, on the one hand, to encourage economic authorities to design policies which support the social start-up process and the social business persistence and, on the other hand, to encourage economists of being aware of the importance to teach and research Economics from a different perspective.},

First it reflects on the role and responsibility of researchers in advancing social innovation and traces the purpose and activities of the New Zealand Social Innovation and Entrepreneurship Research Centre to illustrate how academic institutes might catalyze social innovation. Second, it highlights parallel discourses following either more micro- or macro-level leanings. At the micro level, accompanying a growing literature on social entrepreneurship is an embedded discussion on social innovation linked to innovations by social entrepreneurs. More overarching research centres on broad processes of innovation, implications of a new innovation paradigm and social innovations concerning societal issues. Bringing these two research streams closer and bridging dichotomous micro-macro perspectives, is necessary for a holistic view of innovation that recognizes social innovation as a crucial facet of innovation systems. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

abstract={'Social innovation' is a construct increasingly used to explain the practices, processes and actors through which sustained positive transformation occurs in the network society (Mulgan, G., Tucker, S., Ali, R., Sander, B. (2007). Social innovation: What it is, why it matters and how can it be accelerated. Oxford: Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship; Phills, J. A., Deiglmeier, K., & Miller, D. T. Stanford Social Innovation Review, 6(4):34-43, 2008.). Social innovation has been defined as a novel solution to a social problem that is more effective, efficient, sustainable, or just than existing solutions, and for which the value created accrues primarily to society as a whole rather than private individuals. (Phills, J. A., Deiglmeier, K., & Miller, D. T. Stanford Social Innovation Review, 6(4):34-43, 2008: 34.) Emergent ideas of social innovation challenge some traditional understandings of the nature and role of the Third Sector, as well as shining a light on those enterprises within the social economy that configure resources in novel ways. In this context, social enterprises - which provide a social or community benefit and trade to fulfil their mission - have attracted considerable policy attention as one source of social innovation within a wider field of action (see Leadbeater, C. (2007). 'Social enterprise and social innovation: Strategies for the next 10 years', Cabinet office, Office of the third sector http://www.charlesleadbeater.net/cms/xstandard/social-enterprise-innovation.pdf. Last accessed 19/5/2011.). And yet, while social enterprise seems to have gained some symbolic traction in society, there is to date relatively limited evidence of its real world impacts. (Dart, R. Not for Profit Management and Leadership, 14(4):411-424, 2004.) In other words, we do not know much about the social innovation capabilities and effects of social enterprise. In this chapter, we consider the social innovation practices of social enterprise, drawing on Mulgan, G., Tucker, S., Ali, R., Sander, B. (2007). Social innovation: What it is, why it matters and how can it be accelerated. Oxford: Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship: 5) three dimensions of social innovation: new combinations or hybrids of existing elements; cutting across organisational, sectoral and disciplinary boundaries; and leaving behind compelling new relationships. Based on a detailed survey of 365 Australian social enterprises, we examine their self-reported business and mission-related innovations, the ways in which they configure and access resources and the practices through which they diffuse innovation in support of their mission. We then consider how these findings inform our understanding of the social innovation capabilities and effects of social enterprise, and their implications for public policy development. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

abstract={"Since creation of new economic order in the form of new firms is what entrepreneurs do, complexity science makes much more sense as the preferred kind of science for entrepreneurial research" (McKelvey, 2004: 314). This article considers the application of complexity science to a particular type of entrepreneurial research: social entrepreneurship. We explore Hector's World, a social venture whose purpose is to educate "digital tots" about digital citizenship. We begin by briefly outlining Hector's World Ltd which then acts as a contextual backdrop for exploring the complexity model of social innovation (Goldstein, Hazy & Silberstang, 2009, 2010) and the concepts of attractors, self organization and emergence. Emergence is then considered from a Schumpeterian inspired perspective as the combining and recombining of various resources. We suggest that within Hector's World "digital citizenship" emerged as an attractor through a bifurcation process and argue that the key to its successful emergence centers on the combination and recombination of resources and the interactions of various systems within the social networks of Hector's World. Of particular interest is the impact these interactions have on the key parameters and attractor bifurcation within this system as innovation and change emerges. We suggest that exploring and applying complexity thinking, specifically a social innovation perspective, to social innovation within Hector's World can usefully contribute to an emergence-based theory of social innovation.},

To fulfill the research objective, the specific case of Bioplaneta was selected for in-depth analysis. This civil association supports socially disadvantaged Mexican communities through the creation of environmentally responsible businesses. The specification of activities performed by the integrants of Bioplaneta's network shows the main role of the SE is to facilitate the exchange of knowledge, the accumulation of resources and the management of symbiotic relationships among private and public organisations. The case concludes this social entrepreneur is able to capitalise market opportunities, thanks to its relationships with multiple institutions. Copyright © 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={Over the years there has been a phenomenal growth in the number of social enterprises in India. This is partly a consequence of a new policy of the government to gradually withdraw from social development activities. The gap thus created is being filled by social enterprises. A social enterprise can be a for-profit or not-for-profit venture engaged in income-generating activities with an agenda of bringing positive change in the society. While social enterprises are engaged in the development of people, it is rather paradoxical that they experience a variety of problems with respect to the management of human resources within their enterprises. It is common knowledge that social enterprises perennially struggle with various critical human resources issues such as getting employees at low rates of compensation, providing growth opportunities for employees within the organization, retaining talent especially in the middle management, providing clearly defined roles and tasks to employees, leading to high attrition and increasing the cost of acquiring and training new employees. Thus, it becomes critical for social enterprises to think out-of-the-box and try a variety of innovative strategies to overcome these problems. This paper discusses a few such innovative HR strategies adopted by social enterprises to attract and retain talent, such as offering jobs to people with vision and value congruence, enhancing the credibility of the organization through brand building, providing opportunities for personal growth, creating a sense of ownership among employees through participation in decision making, creating sense of ownership among employees by giving equity shares, creating entrepreneurial opportunities within the organization, finding employees from among beneficiaries, attracting employees to serene lifestyle in peaceful and scenic location and providing attractive fringe benefits to the employees. Collectively these strategies seem to suggest that social enterprises adopt a 'partnership paradigm' for managing their employees.},

abstract={Using the life story method, 18 social bricoleurs (small scale social entrepreneurs) from eight countries were interviewed to identify motivations in becoming social entrepreneurs. Motivations included pull factors, such as an awareness of social injustice, and push factors, such as job dissatisfaction. Analysis indicates that social bricoleur motivations are similar in different cultures. When referring to the present or future, many social entrepreneurs seek scalability, i.e., an expansion of their vision and actions evolving from small scale organisations to larger organisations that serve multiple populations and needs.

abstract={A central question guides this article: To what extent can entrepreneurship be a force for change and transformation in war-torn areas? To address the question, this article introduces the topic of social entrepreneurship and illustrates how social entrepreneurs are serving as change agents in rebuilding and reconstructing areas devastated by conflict. The social enterprise of Kiva, the brainchild of social entrepreneurs Matthew Flannery and Jessica Jackley, provides an example. It is notable for its innovative idea-a Web-based, internet-facilitated micro-loan process that attracts individual investors worldwide in support of business entrepreneurs in the developing world. As a counter example to top-down, mandate-driven, organization-centric intervention strategies that many organizations pursue in peace operations, Kiva's enduring legacy may very well be its bottom-up, entrepreneur-driven, network-centric model of change. Its most salient features are: a supply chain that 'contractually' connects all the partners in the loan process to minimize coordination problems and ensure that each step in the workflow sequentially adds value; processes and systems that guarantee work is transparent, efficient and accountable; a model of learning that enables global and local partners to co-create a complex, worldwide community-based learning system in support of entrepreneurship; and a rich network of social relations built from face-to-face and online interactions to help generate social capital needed for development. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Social entrepreneurship is not just an objective description of a phenomenon; it also carries a positive normative connotation. However, the academic discourse barely reflects social entrepreneurship’s inherent normativity and often grounds it implicitly on the mission of a social enterprise. In this paper, we argue critically that it is insufficient to ground social entrepreneurship’s inherent normativity on a social mission. Instead, we will show how such a mission-centric conception of social entrepreneurship, when put into practice, is prone to enhance rather than diminish societal grievances. In order to give social entrepreneurship an explicit and sound ethical grounding, we draw on integrative economic ethics as a frame of reference. From this perspective, social entrepreneurship necessitates adherence to the discourse-ethically reasoned moral principle in order to live up to its inherent normative validity claim of good entrepreneurship. The consideration of social entrepreneurship practices is crucial to make this approach less vulnerable to ethical critique. The addition of a practice dimension overcomes the mission-centric view of social entrepreneurship and opens up a typology of enterprise forms, thereby enabling a more fine-grained distinction between social enterprises and other forms of organization. © 2020, The Author(s).},

A systematic literature review following PRISMA guidelines was used to evaluate the existing evidence from the literature. The paper consolidates the views into a comprehensive framework integrating the different elements of S-ENT education. The framework describes the three main components 1). Inputs-which characterize the personal profiles, knowledge, skills, and abilities of the students/learners 2) Process-which constitutes mainly the pedagogical approach specific to S-ENT 3) Output-which specifies the desired changes in social entrepreneurial knowledge, skills and competencies as well as outlines the assessment of S-ENT learning.

abstract={Purpose: Growing inequality and socioeconomic and environmental degradation concerns forces us to think about how innovative technologies can contribute to reduce this problem. This study aims to analyze the potential of social cryptocurrencies to enhance the community development and cooperation between small businesses of the near environment. The evolution of these technology-based schemes could be key factors for generating innovative social enterprises, improving the quality of life in the community; in this way generate a conceptual model to sustainable development, while being more transparent, efficient and scalable as they are supported by technological applications. Design/methodology/approach: Based on an in-depth study of the relevant literature, a conceptual model was designed. The concept of social cryptocurrency is proposed as a new approach to virtual currencies for social purposes and sustainable development. Findings: The key findings point out that actors such as innovation and social entrepreneurship will come together in a new generation of social currencies, extending cryptocurrency technology to social business domains. Research limitations/implications: The impact of this will result in a better quality of life for society and the achievement of several sustainable development goals. However, a limitation would be that its scope depends on certain characteristics of the local environment. Furthermore, the proposed model will require validation in later phases through social experiments. Originality/value: The main contribution of this paper is in structuring a formal model that, based on empirical experiences and the use of the technology that underlies cryptocurrencies, proposes a set of constituent elements and characterizes them to contribute to achievement of sustainable development. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={We examine the role that extracurricular activities and student-led activity clubs at institutions of higher education play in the development of social entrepreneurial competences of the graduating youth in emerging market settings. Relying on a single case study approach, we adopt a narrative inquiry into the journey of an undergraduate student in the UAE who longed to build a sense of community at his university aimed at generating positive social spillovers. Our study demonstrates the critical role that the sanction-free university environment plays in the activation of social entrepreneurial behaviors and intentions of students in the UAE. Decision makers are urged to reconceptualize the educational institution as a place of not just learning, but also practicing the entrepreneurial skills of the future generation of social leaders. Students who get exposed to practical activities during their studies have an edge in the labor market due to greater employability skills. Universities that invest in social entrepreneurship education contribute to the development of social leaders of tomorrow and also attract more scholarships through their strengthened network of alumni. Our qualitative inquiry seeks to stimulate more scholarly interest in conducting culturally relevant research on student-led social entrepreneurship endeavors in the context of Middle Eastern universities. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In prior studies, several researchers have adopted entrepreneurial orientation (EO) in determining students’ intention toward entrepreneurship, although the application of EO is scant in determining intention toward social entrepreneurship in existing literature. Hence, in consideration of this research gap, the current study empirically examines the influence of the dimensions of social entrepreneurial orientation (SEO): social vision, social proactiveness, innovativeness, and risk-taking motive on graduate students’ entrepreneurial intention toward social entrepreneurship-based business start-up. An online-based survey method was used to collect data from a sample of 465 students purposively who were studying at different universities in Bangladesh. A PLS-based SEM was applied to analyze the data and examined the proposed relationships in the conceptual model. The findings reveal that Graduate students’ social proactiveness, innovativeness, and risk-taking motive significantly affect their social entrepreneurial intention. However, students’ social vision does not have direct influence but has indirect influence on social entrepreneurial intention through their social entrepreneurial attitudes. The research contributes to the body of knowledge in the existing social entrepreneurship literature as well as provides practical implications for the policymakers, practitioners, and stakeholders working toward flourishing of social-based entrepreneurship, venture, and start-up. © 2021 by the authors.

Design/methodology/approach: Adopting an exploratory approach, it analyzes the answers of a questionnaire, created using Google Forms and administered via social networks and e-mails. To analyze the answers statistical tests and descriptive statistics were used. The survey reveals potential behavioral factors, which influence the participation propensity to share economic practices. Findings: Results exhibit that the age of the consumer is an impactful participating factor of sharing economy, and therefore, it seems to be a discriminant. On the contrary, gender and annual income are insignificant determinants. Research limitations/implications: The sample is unbalanced, the majority of the answers were provided by young people. Social implications: The paper can give a picture of the role and the importance of the sharing economy in Italy.

Data were collected from a sample survey of 503 individuals. The four-step method suggested by Baron and Kenny (1986) was followed to test the mediational roles of perceived desirability and perceived feasibility in the relationship between six personality traits (need for achievement, risk-taking propensity, innovativeness, proactiveness, empathy and moral obligations) and social entrepreneurial intention. The results showed that the two mediators fully mediated the effects of proactiveness on social entrepreneurial intention, whereas both the mediators were found partially mediating the impact of moral obligation on social entrepreneurial intention. In addition, only perceived feasibility fully mediated the effects of innovativeness on social entrepreneurial intention and partially mediated the effects of empathy. These research results are expected to trigger a change in social entrepreneurship education by cultivating personality traits towards sustainable development. This study’s originality lies in its exploration of potential social entrepreneurs’ personality traits as a combination of general entrepreneurial and social entrepreneurial traits. © 2021 SAGE Publications.},

Social entrepreneurship has also gained popularity as a career choice among younger people, including millennials. However, few studies have examined the predictors of intention to engage in social entrepreneurship as a means of both creating public good and serving one's own interests. This article seeks to answer the important question of what drives social entrepreneurial intention. Conceptualizing social entrepreneurship as a public- and private-value response to sustainability challenges, a set of hypotheses regarding the association between public service motivation, money ethics and intention to initiate social entrepreneurship were tested using survey data from 662 millennials in Indonesia. Structural equation modeling and multiple regressions revealed that both public service motivation and money ethics had direct and indirect effects on intention to engage in social entrepreneurship. Public service motivation was a stronger predictor of intention than money ethics were. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Purpose: This study aims to focus on implementing frugal innovation and its principles by social entrepreneurs to face the challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. The research paper discusses the case of an Indian social entrepreneur who works for menstrual health and hygiene of unprivileged and rural women in India. The social entrepreneur’s constant endeavor is to create an ecosystem to ensure rural women’s economic and social upliftment through financial inclusion and livelihood training. When faced with the COVID-19 pandemic, the social entrepreneur re-purposed the manufacturing process to produce masks that were the need of the hour. Design/methodology/approach: The research paper is qualitative and follows an inductive case study approach. The underlying principles of frugal innovation are established through content analysis of the social entrepreneur’s interviews and her team members. Findings: The study discusses how adversity can be an opportunity for social entrepreneurs by implementing frugal innovation principles, i.e. re-use, re-purpose, re-combine and rapidity, in times of crisis. Research limitations/implications: One of the major limitations of this study is that it is based on a single case study, as, in the current scenario, this case appeared to be the most suitable one. There is no way to generalize the assumptions of this model. Researchers will have to study the phenomena of frugal innovation in adversity across multiple cases in the future. Also, the study is based on a single emerging economy, i.e. India. Further research may be carried out with such cases from other countries. Practical implications: The proposition of this research paper will help new and established social entrepreneurs understand that the four principles of frugal innovation and their practical application by a social entrepreneur. This will act as a guiding light for the present and future entrepreneurs regarding how one can respond to a crisis. This will also help advance our understanding of the distinct ways in which social entrepreneurs’ activities can help society in times of crisis. The findings of this research paper provide timely implications for social entrepreneurs. To respond efficiently to various crises, it is important to consider its effect on social entrepreneurship. Social implications: The research paper shows that the social enterprise has implemented frugal innovation principles to manufacture the COVID-19 protection items supplied through existing supply chain networks. Also, a social entrepreneur is not intimidated by the sudden changes in the business environment; instead, they look at the situation as an opportunity to do something new. They are always willing to take the risk to innovate a solution that will address people’s problems. frugal innovation, due to its highly collaborative nature and its ability to make the most from limited resources, is the only way social entrepreneurs can create an inclusive, secure and sustainable future. Originality/value: There are several challenges in social entrepreneurship, especially in emerging economies like India. During the pandemic, availability of resources was the major challenge, due to which social entrepreneurs had to find solutions through frugal innovation. This paper provides the practical application of the four principles of frugal innovation implemented by a social enterprise to manufacture and supply Covid protection items. It also presents the practical and managerial implications of the principles of frugal innovation by social entrepreneurs in low resource settings. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the European Union (EU) through heavy pressure on health services, business activity and people's life. To mitigate these effects, government agencies, civil society and the private sector are working together in proposing innovative initiatives. In this sense, this study aims to characterize and explore the relevance of these projects to mitigate the effects of COVID-19. Design/methodology/approach: The Observatory of Public Sector Innovation provided by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development was considered to enable the identification and exploration of innovative projects to combat COVID-19. A methodology based on mixed methods is adopted to initially identify quantitatively the distribution of these projects, followed by a qualitative approach based on thematic analysis that allows exploring their relevance. Findings: A total of 206 initiatives in the EU have been identified. The distribution of these projects is quite asymmetric, with Portugal and Austria totaling 33.52% of these projects. Most of these projects focus on the areas of public health, infection detection and control, virtual education, local commerce, digital services literacy, volunteering and solidarity and hackathons. Originality/value: This work is relevant to identifying and understanding the various areas in which COVID-19 initiatives have been developed. This information is of great relevance for the actors involved in this process to be able to replicate these initiatives in their national, regional and local contexts. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Innovation systems are increasingly oriented towards the solution of societal and environmental problems. Social entrepreneurship can be regarded as a market-based actor, inherently aimed at finding solutions for these problems. The development of technologically advanced social entrepreneurship represents an outcome of problem-oriented innovation systems, requiring a closer link between social and technological innovation. Nonetheless, the literature has not yet explored a key element of these innovation systems: the technology transfer processes, which may enable social entrepreneurial organizations to act as innovation actors leveraging on technology. This paper investigates the relationship between the technology transfer processes targeting social entrepreneurship and different models of problem-oriented innovation ecosystems. The paper relies on a multiple-case-study design, including two problem-oriented innovation ecosystems in the Italian context, namely, MIND and Torino Social Impact, which are technology transfer projects designed to target social entrepreneurship. Drawing from content analysis of interviews, documents and direct observations, the results stress that the different objectives and contents of technology transfer, coupled with different perceptions of the idiosyncratic features of social entrepreneurship compared to commercial entrepreneurship, fit different ecosystem models in terms of the participating actors, governance and primary orientation to social or economic value generation. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={The paper presents the first attempt to apply a multiple criteria approach to map ecological-inclusive business models and to structure their main features, in terms of sustainable development. Ecological-inclusive business models are presented in this study, and 15 cases pertaining to agro-food organisations located in Sub-Saharan Africa are considered. These companies simultaneously deliver positive social and environmental value, and confirm a well-established market presence. As far as social value is concerned, the companies included in the sample use a Bottom-of-Pyramid approach, involving low-income customers and/or low-income business partners. As for environmental value, all the analysed companies implement frugal innovation or sustainable exploitation of natural resources in the afro-food sector. One of the results that has been achieved is that of disentangling the complexity behind a triple bottom-line business model through a multidimensional analysis framework that identifies the aspects that play a fundamental role in ecological-inclusive business models. An evaluation model and the application of a multiple criteria outranking method are proposed as examples of how some criteria, such as the extent of socio-environmental concerns, strategy orientation and value of partnerships can be used to compare, rank and/or select business models to facilitate decision makers. This work presents the results of an interdisciplinary study on the social entrepreneurship field of knowledge. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Conventional microfinance institutions (MFIs) can promote financial inclusion, but they also prompt ethical concerns regarding the social consequences of commercialization and high interest rates. Islamic MFIs, which adhere to Sharia's prohibition of riba (usually interpreted as a ban on interest), present an alternative. Differences between conventional and Islamic MFIs in terms of outreach and financial sustainability remain underexplored; no comprehensive data set details Islamic MFIs either. With new data, collected with a global survey, the authors construct a unique panel of 543 conventional and 101 Islamic MFIs, operating in Islamic and non-Islamic countries. These data suggest that the market for Islamic microfinance is more important than previously recognized, has grown in recent years, and is likely to continue growing in every region of the world. Statistical comparisons, using various estimation techniques, regarding the outreach and financial performance of Islamic and conventional MFIs also reveal that the breadth and depth of Islamic MFIs exceed those of conventional MFIs, though conventional MFIs achieve stronger financial performance. This latter result is not robust though. © 2020 The Authors},

While the macromarketing literature has long considered the significance of social enterprise and nonprofits, gender has not been theorized within these studies. In redressing this gap we examine the case of the Uniform Project, spearheaded by disaffected advertising executive and enthusiastic social entrepreneur, Sheena Matheiken. Our critical interrogation of the project shows that Matheiken’s path to becoming entrepreneurial “woman of the year” reinforces a gendered model of social entrepreneurship. We also expose the role of media and the forums designed to encourage social innovations in gendering, thus stifling, a social enterprise. We reaffirm the importance of theorizing gender ideology in macromarketing and submit that any such theorization must recognize and account for the ways that gender intersects with neoliberal ideology to permeate markets, marketing and social enterprise. © The Author(s) 2020.},

abstract={Social entrepreneurship (SE) is often viewed as an effective means to promote social well-being (SWB). However, how SE emerges from a country’s institutional and social context, and consequently, how the institutional and social embeddedness of SE influences the level of SWB in a particular country, remains unanswered. This study, utilizing fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), addresses these questions by exploring, (1) the configurations of institutional and social capital conditions that lead to high prevalence rates of different types of SE activities in a country, and (2) the configurations of such institutionally and socially embedded SE activities that deliver high level of SWB in a country. It advances the SE literature by revealing the embeddedness and configurational nature of SE. Specifically, multiple equifinal configurations of socio-political conditions can lead to high prevalence rates of not-for-profit SE and hybrid SE. Moreover, this study finds that while both not-for-profit SE and hybrid SE can facilitate SWB by interacting with socio-political conditions, they do so through different mechanisms. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={As social problems become more extensive and diverse, one of the most critical capabilities of social entrepreneurs is connecting and aligning various stakeholders. Social entrepreneurs can solve problems better through collaboration with stakeholders, and this leads to sustainable innovation of society. Accordingly, social entrepreneurship education (SEE) programs should be designed and operated to cultivate social entrepreneurs’ abilities to enhance connectivity with all relevant entities of the social enterprise ecosystem. Consequently, SEE can form ever‐growing communities of social entrepreneurs while functioning as innovation hubs for entrepreneurial ecosystems (EEs) evolving on their own. To this end, this study proposes a design and assessment framework for SEE. The framework emphasizes strengthening internal connectivity among SEE program members and external connectivity with outside entities, including universities, firms, government agencies, civil societies, and natural environments. This framework clarifies how and to whom social entrepreneurs should connect throughout the SEE process. This paper analyzes the case of an MBA degree SEE program in Korea using this framework and identifies directions for further improvement of SEE, contributing to the social entrepreneurship and entrepreneurship education literatures by integrating SEE’s key features with social theories of learning and the quintuple helix model for sustainable innovation ecosystems. Practically, our findings provide a useful benchmark to find isolated internal and external entities that need more active interactions to achieve SEE’s purposes. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={Social entrepreneurial intentions have become a key area of interest in the entrepreneurship discourse. Studies conducted in developed countries have shown that crucial determinants involve previous experience, mediated by empathy, moral obligation, self-efficacy and perceived social support. This paper brings new contributions on such determinants by replicating Hockerts (2017) on a developing country, a rather distinct social reality when compared to other analyses. We successfully replicated the results on social entrepreneurial determinants, except on the effect of empathy and perceived social support, in the case of individuals with very low income. These have important implications for policy and research as it shows the importance of developing incentives considering contextual drivers and the need to explore how theories developed in more privileged scenarios would persist or change under more unstable and challenging environments. We also suggest that the application of items in different contexts goes beyond careful translation and validation, requiring a deeper consideration of the context in which the data is collected, with direct implications for results interpretation and discussions. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

One of the constantly re-occurring themes in the research on impact measurement is the tension between financial return and social/environmental mission. However, we challenge this binary view by addressing the following questions: is the profit/purpose trade-off dilemma an immutable feature of impact investing? And, if so, how are investor-investee relationships negotiated through those tensions to keep the impact measurement process flowing productively? Using an exploratory multi-round Delphi Method study (15 panellists) and 22 semi-structured interviews, we discover a new set of impact measurement practices, which are relational and non-transactional in nature. These two levels of engagement, the transactional and the relational, occur in sequence and reinforce each other, ultimately creating both instrumental and intrinsic value. In the end, we propose the Transactional-Relational Spiral model and encourage further research and validation. © 2020},

Design/methodology/approach: In order to build a typology of social entrepreneurs, inductive profile analysis and archival research design approaches were used. A large variety of social entrepreneur profiles that are available in prominent social entrepreneurship organizations such as Ashoka Foundation, Echoing Green, Schwab Foundation and Skoll Foundation were examined. Findings: Using four types of social entrepreneurs from the typology, the authors developed a number of predictions as to how social entrepreneurs with an activist background may benefit more in the short term but possibly struggle in the long term given their attachment to their venture's “original” cause and lack of corporate/business experience. Originality/value: By developing a typology of social entrepreneurs and discussing the implications of this typology for post-launch social venture performance, the paper advances the current understanding of social entrepreneurs and the performance of their ventures. Additionally, by focusing on social entrepreneurs as agents of social change, this paper sheds some light on who these entrepreneurs are, what kind of life and career experiences they had and what motivates them to engage in social entrepreneurship. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the dimensions of inclusive and grassroots innovations operationalised by a social enterprise and the impact of these activities on urban regeneration. To this end, the case of Homebaked in Liverpool, UK, is presented and discussed. Design/methodology/approach: Face-to-face interviews with members of Homebaked’s management, staff and volunteers were conducted; the interviews were complemented with on-site observations and review of archival information of the social enterprise. Findings: The data gathered revealed the organisation’s involvement in both types of innovation as a means to achieve long-term urban regeneration related goals. For instance, innovative, strategic and human dimensions, together with the human dimension emerged as key ways of innovating. The impacts of innovative practices comprised encouraging inclusiveness among residents and non-residents, with approaches including hands-on training workshops, job and volunteering opportunities being predominant. Originality/value: First, the study advances the theoretical and applied understanding of grassroots and inclusive innovation in the context of a social enterprise. For instance, an innovative/strategic and human dimension emerged as predominant ways in which grassroots and inclusive innovation elements were manifested. These dimensions were based on technology uptake, implementation of new product/service concepts or harnessing the skills of local and non-local individuals. Similarly, four dimensions associated with the impacts of these types of innovation were revealed. Second, the study addresses acknowledged gaps in the literature, particularly regarding the limited contributions illuminating processes and determinants of innovation among social enterprises. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Learning outcomes: The broad teaching objective is underpinned by the themes of purpose and partnerships. This is taught through application of business model innovation for sustainability where the value proposition is broadened to social and environmental, and multi-stakeholder partnerships in a time of crisis. Students will be expected to analyse the above concepts through a meso (sustainable value), micro (business models) and macro (ecosystems) lens. Upon completion of the case study discussion, successful students will be able to better understand the three features that support sustainable value, explore how a global pandemic can create new business models and partnerships to create social value and analyse how business ecosystems operate against the 6 C framework. Case overview / synopsis: Discovery Holdings Limited is a leading financial service organisation in South Africa, and its Digital Health division is responsible for the platform which delivers telemedicine offerings to doctors and patients. The case highlights the development of the telemedicine offering and the period that is covered spans from the launch of the Discovery DrConnect platform in 2017 to April 2020. Adrian Moss is the protagonist in the case. He is a manager in the Special Projects, Digital Health team of Discovery Health, responsible for the DrConnect project. His challenge is how to raise more awareness of the DrConnect offering and how to enhance uptake from doctors and patients. COVID-19 and the lockdown in South Africa in March and April of 2020 presented an opportunity for both doctors and patients to use telemedicine as a new way of engagement and treatment. Complexity academic level: This case is appropriate for masters, MBA and executive education students focusing on the fields of study of environment of business, strategy, business model innovation and social entrepreneurship.

abstract={Hybridity is a widely used concept for framing social enterprising as the combination of business and social welfare. By comparing two work integration enterprises from Glasgow and Vienna, this article sheds light on the locally constituted meaning of hybridity in Scotland and Austria. Many organizations comfortably fit into a formal, synchronic and isolated interpretation of hybridity, while in-depth-analysis often shows that organizations have a strong unbalance between their social and economic rationale. This discussion over real versus false hybridity of organizations inaccurately places notions of social and economic value in absolute terms, whereas we argue that their meaning is negotiated locally. The middle ground between profit and altruism is shifting due to particular, historically evolved institutions, markets, actors and welfare regimes. © 2020 Universidad Complutense de Madrid.

abstract={Purpose: This paper aims to provide a comprehensive vision of the formation of intra-metropolitan clusters triggered by the deindustrialization of an urban area, namely, the district of Porto Marghera in the metropolitan area of Venice and propose possible regeneration scenarios based on intra-metropolitan clustering. Design/methodology/approach: This paper adopts a multi-disciplinary approach and relies on both descriptive and qualitative evidence to show the economic transition occurred in the area of Porto Marghera in recent years. Findings: Evidence shows the rise of two potential clusters in the KIBS and the creative industries in a well-delimited fringe area placed at the boundary between the urban centre and the core of the deindustrialized zone. Such clustering processes have been, however, characterized by two different and in some way alternative paths. The former stems from the combination of two autonomous entrepreneurial ideas that complemented one to each other. The latter relies on university-industry collaboration and on the presence of places of informal exchanges that proved to support personal networking, knowledge exchange and business opportunities. Research limitations/implications: This paper suggests that local development policies could leverage on the presence of social entrepreneurs to substitute the creation of amenities and the provision of public goods in fragile territories. Originality/value: This paper shows that, in presence of specific spatial conditions, deindustrialization can stimulate the formation of new intra-metropolitan through both top-down and bottom-up agglomeration process. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Social entrepreneurship is an underrated subject in the field of sports. For Romanian society, the fall of communism opened up new opportunities in the entrepreneurial domain. At the same time, entrepreneurship began to intersect with sports, and the results were often productive. Sport is seen as a domain that could inspire entrepreneurship through its principles. The similarities between these two fields have created the perspective of common action in sport and entrepreneurship, and this coexistence has improved during times of social change. After 1989, Romania was confronted with many challenges at the societal level, and sport offered a way to address and to tackle social problems. Through sport, some athletes decided to contribute to issues of individuals or communities. They assumed the status of a social entrepreneur, and developed activities that could inspire others. This paper intends to gather examples of such social entrepreneurship from Romania, and to identify the elements that lead to success. The research takes into consideration case studies from various domains, and this diversity helps us to better understand the challenges of Romanian sport when it interacts with social entrepreneurship. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Social entrepreneurship research highlights the collaborative nature of social entrepreneurial efforts. Further, acknowledging the embeddedness of social ventures in the wider socio-economic and cultural context, the literature stresses the need to move our analysis from the micro-level of intra-organisational practices to the meso-level of inter-organisational dynamics. To answer to these calls, the article engages Fligstein’s and McAdam’s theory of strategic action fields (SAF) to investigate the dynamics of the inter-organisational collaborative work of social ventures. Empirical material comes from the efforts of a social venture to scale up to a new city through developing a cross-sectoral collaboration with the city administration. Findings indicate the risk of mission drift that weaker partners in SAFs run when collaborating with incumbent actors. In this doing, the study illustrates how a meso-level analysis can further our understanding of social entrepreneurial ventures in particular, and cross-sectoral partnerships in general. © 2018, International Society for Third-Sector Research and The Johns Hopkins University.},

abstract={Research to date has not explored that the role of entrepreneurship has a key driver of China’s economic growth and how the nature of entrepreneurship may differ between India and China in this context. This difference will have implications on the extent of entrepreneurship as a driver of Indian economic growth. The aim of this paper is to fill this research gap. Furthermore, one of the central premises of this paper is that the economic reforms in China have provided an incentive for the Chinese to embrace their uniquely cultural entrepreneurial skills. However, this has not happened in isolation because the reforms have targeted all sectors of the economy; the most important of these reforms for entrepreneurial facilitation has been associated with infrastructure, education, property rights, ownership restructuring and foreign direct investment. In this case, changes in infrastructure, knowledge creation and knowledge spillovers have led indirectly to China’s economic growth. This is because knowledge spillovers have been facilitated by entrepreneurship. Moreover, this process has been characterised by the dynamic nature of institutional change in China. Nevertheless, in India at state level, there is variation in the level of economic, institutional and infrastructural development. Furthermore, there is also a tendency for firms in India to remain small. This may be due to the country’s rigid labour laws. The findings of this paper indicate that entrepreneurship is stronger in China than in India from an economic, cultural and a historical perspective. Private entrepreneurship has been stimulated in China by the incrementally evolving economic reforms which resulted in the dynamic nature of institution formation. However, private entrepreneurship in India remains constrained by institutional factors and institutional rigidity. Nevertheless, social entrepreneurship is more prevalent in India than in China. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

The purpose of this paper is to investigate opportunity recognition behaviour of social entrepreneurs and closely related unique attributes of empathy, moral judgement (MRJ) and self-efficacy, in an emerging market African context. Design/methodology/approach: A survey was administered to social entrepreneurs across two of the largest provinces in South Africa, namely Cape Town and Gauteng. Hypotheses were statistically tested using correlational analysis and hierarchical regression with mediation effects. Findings: Results reveal that social entrepreneurial self-efficacy (ESE) plays a significant mediating effect in the relationship between MRJ and social opportunity recognition. Moreover, perceived MRJ and social ESE act as important determinants of increased social opportunity recognition. Originality/value: This study has brought to attention the relevance of opportunity recognition to social entrepreneurs, while recognising their distinctive features in terms of empathy and MRJ.

abstract={The purpose of this paper is to formulate the new model of social entrepreneurial intention based on social capital dimensions. Authors present a literature review about the relationship between social capital and social entrepreneurial intention to identify gaps. There is no research which uses three dimensions of social capital (structural dimension, relational dimension and cognitive dimension) to measure social entrepreneurial intention, although these three dimensions were introduced in 2000. By developing three dimensions of social capital into three new structures, including perceived social interactions and ties, perceived social trust and perceived shared norms, this study introduces new relationships between these structures and social entrepreneurial intention.

abstract={Using the legitimacy lens from institutional theory and a multi-level analysis of 29,175 Global Entrepreneurship Monitor respondents from 16 countries, we examine how national culture and societal attitudes influence individual level decisions to allocate entrepreneurial talent into revenue generating and not-for-profit social enterprises. We find the stigma of business failure to be positively associated with the probability that individuals will invest their entrepreneurial talents into a social venture. We also find that in both performance-based cultures and socially supportive cultures, the positive effects of the stigma of business failure on social entrepreneurship entry are decreased. Our findings suggest that informal institutions significantly influence the revenue generating-strategy of social entrepreneurship. However, they have no significant correlation to the nonprofit-strategy of social entrepreneurship. These findings underscore the complexity of balancing the competing logics of profit maximisation with social value maximisation in the decision to organise start-ups as social enterprises. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Start-ups, to which two-thirds of radical sustainable innovations are credited, have been identified as the driving force of the green-tech industry. Linking green-tech start-ups with open innovation, this study used semi-structured expert interviews to identify key partners for open innovation, providing insights into core opportunities and risks emerging in the innovation process. The results showed that green-tech start-ups rely on both inbound and outbound innovation. The study identified key open innovation network partners, namely academic institutes, support platforms/other start-ups, incumbent firms, and customers. Although opportunities and risks appear to be partner-specific, they can be related to three distinct levels of impact: Firm development, technology development, and technology commercialisation. Synergetic partnerships, such as R&D collaborations with universities and incumbent firms, create opportunities at all three levels. Risks affect particularly the level of technology and of firm development. This paper contributes to the literature through key findings addressing five propositions. © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

As this area of knowledge is still incipient in the present literature, this study aims to develop and validate a scale to understand how social entrepreneurs identify social innovations generated by their entrepreneurships. Design/methodology/approach – In order to validate the scale, we applied it to 264 social enterprises in the 27 confederative units of Brazil. The statistical techniques used, besides the descriptive analysis of frequencies and central tendency and variability measures, were exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Findings – The results point to a validated scale consisting of 23 items that classify and identify social innovations of the product, organizational, and marketing types, and of incremental, disruptive, and institutional depths. Originality/value – The contribution to the understanding lies in the fact that the scale may stimulate social entrepreneurs or new entrants to better allocate their resources or their attention to certain types of social innovations in order to achieve better results for their entrepreneurships. © FECAP.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of the work is to develop recommendations for development of entrepreneurship in growth poles of the modern global economy on the basis of activation and increase of effectiveness of marketing management. Methodology: Comparative analysis of the existing conceptual approaches to determining new growth poles of the modern global economy is performed, and it is substantiated that these approaches do not contradict but supplement each other. Contrary to the pre-crisis model, there has formed a two-pole model of growth of the modern global economy, which poles are technological and social entrepreneurship, which are selected as the objects of this research. Regression analysis is used for determining the influence of the level of marketing activity (index 11.08 Extent of marketing, given in the Global competitiveness report) on the level of development of technological (which indicators is the volume of hi-tech export) and social (which indicator is the share of renewable energy in the total structure of energy production) entrepreneurship. The research is performed based on the 2018 data. Results: It is determined that as of now (2018) marketing management of technological and social entrepreneurship in growth poles of the modern global economy is conducted fragmentarily, which restrains its development. Activation and systemic application of all directions of marketing management of technological and social entrepreneurship—marketing research, marketing of relations with intermediaries, HR marketing and product marketing—will allow intensifying development of growth poles of the modern global economy and ensuring quick post-crisis restoration of the global economic system. Recommendations: For better study of marketing potential, the authors developed a perspective model of marketing management of technological and social entrepreneurship in growth poles of the modern global economy. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

abstract={This study aims to explore whether the time-money constraint in tourism can be exerted to foster unconventional social innovation in the tourism industry. This study builds its conceptual framework upon the concept of time banking as an alternative currency in spurring social innovation in the tourism economy. To explore the applicability of the concept in tourism, we investigated the intentions and needs of the supplier and consumer sides through interviews and focus groups. To explore the entrepreneurial perspective, three in-depth interviews were conducted respectively with the co-founder of TimeRepublik, an independent social entrepreneur, and a sharing economy specialist. Three focus groups were also conducted to evaluate and elaborate the practical application of the framework from a user’s point of view. We found that using time as a measure of work shows a potential to reconcile the time-money constraint especially for disadvantaged groups. However, this study has exposed discrepancies between the intentions and the needs of the social entrepreneurs and the users, undermining the feasibility of the concept in the tourism context. Namely, the challenges included the value of time, trust and relationship building, and network effects and scaling. As long as the innovation is unable to achieve inclusive and sustainable growth building upon its social values, the lack of user support will only lead to selected and limited application of the concept in tourism and therefore would fail to generate social benefits on a larger scale. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={There has been limited study on the role of the startup ecosystem in social entrepreneurship. This article addresses the gap by applying a theoretical framework of startup ecosystem to two social enterprises originating from a Singapore university, examining how they engage with stakeholders to create social impact. WateRoam Pte Ltd is a water innovation startup that deploys cost-effective water filtration solutions to rural communities and disaster-hit locations. Tware is a wearable technology startup with a range of therapeutic products for individuals with autism, stress or anxiety. The two cases provide insights on the ecosystem for social ventures in Singapore. The Finance domain is identified as a potential area of improvement, as there is uncertainty on the appropriate growth trajectory for funding. University incubation and mentor networks are found to be pivotal in extending the Markets domain. Finally, this study highlights the Supports domain in the form of university R&D facilities and accelerator programmes that have been instrumental in strengthening connections. Extending beyond the university context, it is evident that infrastructural resources in the ecosystem are crucial. Policymakers may draw on the experience of countries, like Israel, which have successfully built such support facilities to nurture innovation-based social enterprises. © 2019 SAGE Publications.},

As a result of a cluster analysis, we propose an explicit characterization: Social entrepreneurship organizations are those which offer social solutions (referred to as social orientation) that are marketable (referred to as market orientation). These organizations approach social problems using revolutionary innovation, which provides a meaningful and higher level of satisfaction for the participants in the system (referred to as creation of a new system). Finally, we discuss and contrast this characterization with the two other organizational forms emerging from a cluster analysis (social service providers and innovation promoters) as well as associated practices in the literature (e.g., corporate social responsibility and corporate philanthropy). © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

It explores the influence of gender and religious faith on the values that inspire social entrepreneurial organisations to engage in positive social change. Design/methodology/approach: Inductive multiple case study research investigates the values manifest in five social entrepreneurial organisations founded and led by women in three Southeast Asian countries. Findings: Organisations and their women-leaders express values related to benevolence, universalism, self-direction and security. Gender and religious faith are found to be mediators that influence approaches to social transformation. Research limitations/implications: Purposive sampling and interpretive research design favour rich description but limit the generalisability of the findings. Further enquiry is needed into the gender-values-religion nexus in social entrepreneurship. Practical implications: Social entrepreneurship is shown to be a process embedded in and motivated by prosocial values of benevolence and social justice and other values of self-direction and security. Findings provide evidence for the critical but often overlooked influence of gender and religious faith on the values foundation of social entrepreneurship. Social implications: Social entrepreneurial organisations led by women contribute to positive social change through the values they incorporate and express.

abstract={Purpose: This paper aims to re-evaluate social enterprise (SE) history to pinpoint a pluralist turn in communitarian philosophy during the 1970s, which has the potential to transform labour and consumer rights in enterprise development. Design/methodology/approach: Through a close examination of model rules created by founders of the FairShares Association (FSA), the authors find that the communitarian origins of SE are disturbingly obscured and hidden. Findings: In studying FSA documents and building a timeline of the development of the FairShares Model (FSM), the authors found links between SE developments in the UK, continental Europe, Asia, North/South America and the development of solidarity cooperatives. Research limitations/implications: The authors argue that the discovery of a communitarian pluralist turn advances “new cooperativism” by enfranchising both labour and users in industrial relations (IR). Using this insight, they challenge accounts of SE history and argue for more research on SE’s potential contribution to radical IR. Originality/value: The paper highlights the potential of the FSM as a vehicle for catalysing new SE and IR practices that share wealth and power more equitably between social entrepreneurs, workforce members, service/product users and community/social investors. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Social entrepreneurship is a precarious activity that must always strike a delicate balance between commercial principles and social concerns. There is no shortage of discussion concerning the possible solutions that could help to maintain this balance, and social entrepreneurs are striving to reconcile conflicting aims on a daily basis, but the economic roots of this precariousness remain. Based on an analysis of these root causes, we propose a new radical approach to this precariousness, “radical” in the etymological sense of the term “root”. We start by identifying what determines the dilemma that lies at the heart of the precariousness of social entrepreneurship in present-day economic institutions. This enables us to identify the institutional conditions that might allow us to overcome it. The first condition is linked to the conservation of money in individual trade, which might be alleviated. To determine the second condition, we introduce the notion of the endogeneity of the institutional solutions to the dilemma. The lesser the involvement of the actors concerned by its formulation, the less endogenous is the solution. On this basis, we suggest institutional reforms that could prompt entrepreneurs to organize themselves in support of the actions of the most socially oriented entrepreneurs, thus safeguarding their sustainability. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Purpose: The paper aims to examine a citizen-centric model of governmental entrepreneurship that transforms public service management for the empowerment of marginalized women. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopts a qualitative methodology to analyze the distinctive model of a rural livelihoods program in India. A fieldwork was conducted in four villages, a total of 250 women were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire and eight focus-group discussions were conducted. The data were analyzed using constant comparative analysis and discourse analysis. Finally, the findings were shared with women in the study area. Findings: The analysis suggests that the adoption of distinct management for social welfare program results in social legitimacy and social value creation. JEEViKA illustrates that citizen-centric social entrepreneurship model is an outcome of internal and external governance mechanisms, strategy that thrusts on skills and capacity as investment, tools local women (community resource persons) as instruments and targets spatial saturation as an intervention creates political and economic participation, and that marketability promotes power over economic resources that enable freedom from servitude. Research limitations/implications: The model provides a direction to overcome multiple barriers to addressing poverty and marginalization. Practical implications: Poor and government can leverage through the collaborative capacity to meet ever-evolving social needs by developing a state-society partnership in citizen-centric governmental entrepreneurship. Social implications: The policies to overcome large-scale marginalization can adopt citizen-centric model to create social legitimacy that furthers social value among the poor and marginalized rural women. Originality/value: This study provides a model that illustrates government ability to transform marginalized poor as co-producers of development benefits. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The authors argue that social enterprise delivers more than business activity, whether they are for-profit or non-profit. Indigenous social enterprise and social entrepreneurs also bring together Indigenous communities, to work collaboratively for cultural revitalisation and social change. Further, the chapter explores the role of Māori/Indigenous researchers, and Indigenous research methodologies, in contributing to that cultural revitalisation and social change. This case illustrates how social entrepreneurs and researchers, who share cultural capital (in this case, the shared values and world view of an Indigenous people), might work collaboratively to enhance the social capital of the enterprise, and the community. © Anne de Bruin and Simon Teasdale 2019.

Leaders used topdown practices to further organizational development along a known path when they could leverage technical expertise or a vision to address a source of tension. Bottom-up practices, on the other hand, permitted the discovery of new paths that had not been previously identified. Leaders leveraged such responses where tensions appeared intractable.

Since the SCCT model of SEI is still in the early stages and needs to be further developed, experts recommend the use of partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) to analyze data collected from 294 business students from a Philippine university. To account for observed heterogeneity, differences among senior high school and college business students were explored via multigroup analysis (PLS-MGA). Across all respondents, perceived support and internal outcome expectations have the strongest total effects on SEI, while self-efficacy and agreeableness have marginally significant direct effects and significant indirect effects on SEI. This study contributed to the field of social entrepreneurship by looking at alternate and developing explanations to the formation of SEI apart from conceptual models based on the theory of planned behavior. © 2019 Vilnius University.

abstract={There is a large literature on the role of nonprofit enterprises within society. This literature typically views nonprofits as either substitutes for government enterprises or complements to, and even necessary extensions of, these government efforts. While this literature has improved our understanding of the role and importance of nonprofit social enterprises, how social entrepreneurs identify opportunities, allocate resources, and adapt to changing circumstances has been relatively underexplored. Efforts to fill this gap within Austrian economics have categorized nonprofits and identified the limitations of calculation and coordination in the nonprofit sector and the characteristics of successful and unsuccessful nonprofit enterprises. This strand of literature focuses on the differences between economic calculation in for-profit enterprises and decision making in nonprofit enterprises. We argue that another meaningful aspect to determining the ability of nonprofit enterprises to coordinate plans is whether they are structured more like private enterprises and public enterprises. These insights from Austrian economics shed light on why some nonprofits are more effective than others at achieving social goals. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Research question: The aim of this study is to understand and discuss how networking can be manifested in a sport organisation characterised by social entrepreneurship. Research methods: The qualitative data on which this study rests consists of seven semi-structured interviews (totally, ca. 600 minutes). Some interviewees were members of the organisation in question, while others represent various partner organisations. Supplementary data was added in the form of various written sources (e.g. annual reports). Results and Findings: The social entrepreneurial sports organisation's networks encompass many actors from all societal sectors, and the networks themselves may assume many forms (e.g. social, institutional and reputational), as may the character of the cooperation involved. The study shows that several of the networks are characterised not only by a common desire to attain a win-win situation but also by mutual dependency. Through its use of networks, the organisation has reduced its dependence on financial support, a dependency which otherwise tends to burden social entrepreneurial organisations. Thus, the networks enable the organisation to continuously develop its social ambition to improve people's social values through participation in a wide range of sporting and outdoor activities. Implications: This study contributes to a broader understanding of the significance of networks. The results indicate that it is necessary to consider other network types than solely social networks. Besides this, practitioners can transfer a number of the networks described to their own organisations. Consequently, the study constitutes a potential source of inspiration for sports organisations. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={The retail sector is a dynamic and challenging component of contemporary food systems with an important influence on population health and nutrition. Global consensus is clear that policy and environmental changes in retail food environments are essential to promote healthier diets and reduce the burden of obesity and non-communicable diseases. In this article, we explore entrepreneurialism as a form of social change-making within retail food environments, focusing on small food businesses. Small businesses face structural barriers within food systems. However, conceptual work in multiple disciplines and evidence from promising health interventions tested in small stores suggest that these retail places may have a dual role in health promotion: settings to strengthen regional economies and social networks, and consumer environments to support healthier diets. We will discuss empirical examples of health-promoting entrepreneurialism based on two sets of in-depth interviews we conducted with public health intervention actors in Toronto, Canada, and food entrepreneurs and city-region policy actors in St. John’s, Canada. We will explore the practices of entrepreneurialism in the retail food environment and examine the implications for population health interventions. We contend that entrepreneurialism is important to understand on its own and also as a dimension of population health intervention context. A growing social scientific literature offers a multifaceted lens through which we might consider entrepreneurialism not only as a set of personal characteristics but also as a practice in networked and intersectoral cooperation for public and population health. © The Author 2017.

The original methodological framework combines statistical methods and multi-criteria decision making model, in order to evaluate the contribution of different types of enterprises to the employment of excluded individuals. Weights determination for the MCDM model is performed using entropy while TOPSIS method is applied for the ranking of the types of social enterprises according to the employment of socially excluded categories.

Design/methodology/approach: Using the epistemological lens of phenomenological analysis, it focuses on the developmental process elements for the social enterprise leader, between the individual and the environment, and the individual and the community. To formulate the model, multiple data collection methods were utilized. Findings: Analyzing multiple experiences of different social enterprise leaders formed a suggested processual leadership development model, which discovers fundamental elements and skills necessary in their development. Research limitations/implications: Findings provide a foundational basis in the continued development of social entrepreneurs as rooted in the unique experiences of current social enterprise leaders. A limitation worth noting is the contextual distinctiveness of experiences that may shape the leadership experience. Practical implications: Findings provide a baseline theorized framework on the critical facets of leadership development for social enterprise. Pragmatically, this functions as a competency framework that can be transformed into concrete learning activities and training sessions.

abstract={Purpose: This paper aims to examine the geographic distribution of social enterprises at the local sub-district level in one Indian state. Design/methodology/approach: This paper adopts a multimethod approach. The exploratory phase involved interviews and analysis of social enterprise distribution at the national level. Phase 2 involved mapping the distribution of social enterprises at the sub-district level in one state. Distribution around established social enterprises was plotted using latitude–longitude positions. Grounded theory approach to analysing qualitative data was adopted to identify the mechanism for agglomeration. Findings: Social entrepreneurship sees the entrepreneurial problems as solving universalized social problems abstracting them out of the geo-historical and political economic context of the social problem. This study shows that solving a social problem is itself implicated in a social–historical organizational context of aid giving within developing countries. Networks of resources that early enterprises enable draw newer organizations toward them and lead to the formation of clusters. While such clusters might improve chances of enterprise survival, the phenomenon inadvertently leads to a new kind of inequity, as areas with fewer social enterprises lack the organizational infrastructure necessary for delivery of welfare. Research limitations/implications: Research in social enterprises needs to pay more attention to the context of the enterprises or society in addition to its current focus on universal social problems. Social enterprises themselves could be new sources of inequity in terms of the organizational infrastructure they represent. Originality/value: Policymakers need to make directed efforts that respond not only to social problems but also to the socio-historic-organizational contexts where the problems are being solved and seeding the entrepreneurial effort in those spaces. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Despite the development interventions that have been adopted to help the countries caught in a downward spiral of impoverishment, their problems still persist. This paper focuses on the role that traditional foreign aid and the more recent bottom–up approach of supporting social entrepreneurs are playing to tackle the situation of extreme poverty in Zimbabwe. Drawing upon a narrative inquiry, 35 stories were collected to bring fresh insights regarding the realities of such interventions as they are experienced by the local people. The evidence shows the main shortcomings of the current development models and suggests that the improvement of a declining economy such as Zimbabwe would need the interaction of various factors, so that some interventions will appear significant only when the conditions of primary importance exist in the environment. Additionally, the engagement of local people seems to be a key aspect to the success of some of the support measures. © 2018, © 2018 Government Technical Advisory Centre (GTAC).},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effects of introducing business tools into nonprofit organizations (NPOs). Exploring the case of an NPO trying to embrace the social enterprise model, this study aims to contribute to a better understanding of the managerialization process affecting third sector organizations. Design/methodology/approach: Relying on an in-depth ethnographic immersion conducted at a Brazilian NPO, this paper adopts a performativity lens to analyze the appropriation process of a traditional business tool, the Individual Development Plan (IDP), at the organization. Findings: The story of the IDP’s appropriation reveals how business tools act as market devices to actualize economic behaviors and representations among NPOs’ beneficiaries. Reinforcing the control of managers upon their constituencies, business tools can thus create an unequal balance of power within NPOs. Practical implications: Admittedly, this paper relies on one single case study, which imposes strong limitations to generalize empirical findings. Nonetheless, this analysis calls for more caution in the promotion of business tools for the development of social entrepreneurship in third sector organizations. Originality/value: Rather than debating the accuracy and efficiency of business tools in NPOs, this paper adopts a performative approach to understand how artifacts change the nature of relationships between managers and beneficiaries within social ventures. Rejecting a normative stance, this paper proposes a micro-level analysis of managerialization, focusing on an organization from an emerging country, Brazil, which is rarely at the core of social entrepreneurship studies. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Design/methodology/approach: The paper analyses the thematic content of SEJ and its impact data from 2005 until 2017. Findings: SEJ has broken new ground in the study of social enterprise (SE). It was the first journal back in 2005 to commence the exploration of this field and since has been the first to publish works on defining SE, their performance management, critical perspectives plus international differences. The paper shows that in the early years, SEJ was dominated by conceptual work aiming to understand SE plus their governance and performance management, which was mainly based on UK descriptive case studies and uncritical. By 2010, SEJ became established internationally with various issues being 100 per cent dominated by international aspects of SE. Recent more critical work has also enabled a process of “myth busting” in the SE field. This paper also shows the growth of SEJ in downloads and citations. Practical implications: The paper demonstrates the important role SEJ has played in both improving practice and informing policy. Originality/value: The paper is the first to review the development and impact of SEJ. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

We analyse performance data of impact investors both in Australia and globally and map this impact data to the 17 SDGs. We find that impact investors are engaging with language consistent with the SDGs a possible field-level frame to guide impact strategy and measurement. To date, impact investors measure social outcomes more frequently than environmental outcomes; this may be explained, in part, by our analysis that reveals some SDGs create greater points of leverage to generate layers of impact across SDGs. This chapter explains how impact investors are engaging with the pursuit of the SDG agenda. © 2018 by Emerald Publishing Limited. All rights reserved.},

abstract={While the development of civil society organisations in Hungary has been impressive in terms of number and diversity, its influence has remained limited on policy-making. Administrative attempts to draw civil society under tight regulation and control have produced a blurring of the boundaries between the civil and the public spheres that, in turn, has impaired the independent voice and criticism of civil society. Therefore, economic acts based on solidarity and originating from civil society do not automatically form or increase a 'social economy' but become as contested by and as intermingled with political developments as other acts of civil society. This development also has affected the profile of civil activities: against the earlier impressive weight of anti-poverty, anti-racist and human rights engagements, the 'non-risky' activities of sports and leisure services have come to domination. A turn toward declining participation is a warning sign of the decreasing contribution of civil society to everyday democracy. © 2018, Intersections. East European Journal of Society and Politics.},

The data was collected through social entrepreneurship and personal value scales. The results of the data analysis indicated the mean scores for pre-service teachers' perceptions for social entrepreneurship at mostly level, for self-control and intellectualism values at agreement level and religiousness, social skills and honesty values at moderate agreement level. It was found out that there is a moderate positive relationship between pre-service teachers' religiousness, social skill, honesty and self-control values and their social entrepreneurship, while there is a low positive relationship between intellectualism and their social entrepreneurship. Besides, religiousness, social skill, honesty, self-control and intellectualism values significantly predicted pre-service teachers' social entrepreneurships and accounted for 40% of the total variance.

This article is based on an empirical study examining different types of community energy projects such as energy cooperatives, public service utilities and other entrepreneurially oriented initiatives across the European Union. Based on an in-depth analysis of three case studies, the article aims to introduce a social entrepreneurship perspective when discussing the relationship between local embeddedness and different forms of organisation and ownership in community energy. The results indicate that community energy projects can expand beyond the local scale without losing their collective and democratic form of functioning and ownership. Moreover, social movements can act as catalysts for this expansion beyond the local, in a quest for wider social transformation. Social entrepreneurship may provide a suitable analytical lens to avoid the 'local trap' when examining different forms of organisation and ownership in renewable energy, and further explore the question of scaling.},

We propose a scoring technique that is often used for the analysis of multiple-issue negotiations to analyze and manage the stakeholder conflicts. We show how the quantitative assessment of stakeholders’ preferences results in a one-dimensional subjective measure of organizational effectiveness for each stakeholder. Our approach complements recent research by contributing to a quantitative discussion of organizational effectiveness. Due to typical structural features of the employed scoring template, we are able to derive general principles concerning the conflict structure and the interaction of multiple stakeholders. We find that an increase in the number of stakeholders required for an agreement tends to decrease the perceived organizational effectiveness for the initial negotiators. On the other hand, the multitude of possible agreements is also reduced, thereby sharpening the focus on acceptable proposals to the stakeholders involved. © 2016, International Society for Third-Sector Research and The Johns Hopkins University.},

The conceptual base for analysis is the theories developed by Jonker (2012) and Carvalho and Jonker (2015). It has been concluded that market-oriented social innovation has a crucial role in the development social entrepreneurship. Moreover, these NBM should be adjusted to population needs towards societal well-being, by combining creation of shared value, co-creation of value, and multiple value creation.

abstract={This article discusses bricolage in the context of a social enterprise for urban development. It focuses on the case of BDK Limited, and discusses how this organisation contributes to the economic and social development of the British city of Bradford by promoting city-wide film-based cultural consumption and cultural pride. This research used semi-structured interviews, participant observation and documentary analysis to examine this organisation’s different modes of material and ideational bricolage. The entrepreneurs serve as material bricoleurs as they transform the residuals of the city’s industrial past from materials of no use and reminders of backwardness to sites for cultural consumption. This paper also identifies patterns of ideational bricolage. In Bradford, ethnic diversity has long been discursively associated with conflicts and backwardness by local businesses, potential investors, the media and even urban social entrepreneurs themselves. However, in this case study, diversity is re-perceived as a cultural asset for urban tourism and related industries. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Recent years have seen growing interest in the design and implementation of interventions to reduce poverty in developing countries based on social entrepreneurship. While there are numerous examples of this model being applied around the world, we present a case of social entrepreneurship involving carpet weavers in Bamyan, an extremely rural and resource-constrained province in Afghanistan. The investigation demonstrates a process of poverty alleviation that began with poor villagers undertaking the hardest and most mundane production tasks. This work allowed some people to access better education and training and to in due course move on to less onerous employment. We also found that poor Afghans are embedded in stratified communities in which households at relatively higher levels are most able to break the cycle of poverty. The most capable individuals tend to be young and diligent members of slightly more prosperous families with motivation and talent for education and skill acquisition. Poverty-alleviation programs based on social entrepreneurship have the potential to improve living conditions and to launch at least some people on a trajectory of gradual transformation, but the effects are unlikely to diffuse to entire communities. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Malaysia is now faced with the challenge of bringing its economy to greater heights. Cooperation between the government, private sectors and non-governmental sectors is necessary in order to increase the number of entrepreneurs who are able to contribute to the society. This has become a motivating factor for Malaysia to produce more graduates who specialize in social entrepreneurship in accordance to the aims set by the Malaysian Education Blueprint (Higher Education) 2015-2025 and the Malaysian Social Enterprise Blueprint 2015-2018. In order to fill the gap between profit-oriented goals and socially oriented goals, there is a dire need to explore social entrepreneurial intention. In the context of this study, social entrepreneurial intention is identified through social entrepreneurial activities carried out by university students. Next, the aim of this study is to determine social entrepreneurial intention and its differences among students of different status (student and alumni) and university categories (research university, focus university, comprehensive university, and private university). This study uses a survey approach which involved 446 university students and 296 alumni selected through the proportionate stratified sampling method. A questionnaire was used as the research tool. The results revealed that the level of social entrepreneurial intention among students and alumni was moderate. The data also showed that there was no significant difference in social entrepreneurial intention between students and alumni. However, there was a significant difference in social entrepreneurial intention between students from research universities and students from focused universities. This indicates that social entrepreneurial intention among university students needs to be reinforced in order to increase the number of social entrepreneurs in Malaysia. © 2017 Serials Publications Pvt.

Characteristics of three approaches were considered including top-down conventional coordination, communities of practice (CoP) and social entrepreneurship. Previous literature suggests the last two methods can lead to increased bridging social capital, which generates a relationship between social and commercial entrepreneurship. By qualitatively researching two successful case studies in Indonesia, it was found that for a top-down approach using CoP elements, bridging social capital was developed leading to both profit and nonprofit entrepreneurial activities. However, the reverse was also found, even though it was less obvious. For a top down approach with a local leader functioning as a social entrepreneur, bridging social capital was also developed leading to both profit and non-profit entrepreneurial activities. © Copyright 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={This article focuses on the forms and conditions of welfare provision and social work in the transforming welfare state. The Sport Programme (SP) is a municipal sport-based social intervention launched in response to segregation causing tensions in society, crime, and social exclusion. The programme constitutes a case for examination. Sport activities for youths at risk in the SP are assumed to foster a sense of community and social cohesion. The article investigates how ‘the community’ is constructed as a space for social inclusion. A variety of statements articulated by policy makers and municipal administrators are analysed from a governmentality perspective. The analysis suggests that ‘community’ is formed by distinguishing the SP from public welfare and social work and by mobilising civil society in the intervention. Public welfare is problematised as bureaucratic and insufficient, whereas civil society is associated with the potency of voluntarism, authentic leadership, and personal relations based on common identity and shared experiences. By involving a social entrepreneur, the SP mobilises and activates civil society as a means of responding to social problems, forming ‘community’ as a space with a ‘human touch’. Such a partnership re-distributes responsibility for responding to social problems to a variety of agencies. It is discussed how the SP enables role model identification as the primary governing rationale and how this incorporates elements of de-professionalisation in social work. Consideration is given to challenges for social work and to how activating ‘community’ illustrates tendencies and transformations in contemporary Swedish welfare provision. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine why social entrepreneurs in the USA choose to operate an entirely fair trade business and the factors that affect fair trade social entrepreneurship. Fair trade seeks to benefit producers in developing countries by providing a market for their goods in developed countries. Fair trade enables all parties in the supply chain to make living wages and/or a profit. Design/methodology/approach – Using a qualitative multiple case study approach of social entrepreneurs in 35 US fair trade companies, the authors develop a model and nine propositions to explain the findings. Findings – The authors identify three primary motivational factors (ethical belief, religious faith, and business values), four contributory factors that strengthen fair trade engagement (family member involvement, the trend toward for profit status, industry professionalism, and consumer education), and three negative factors that work to discourage involvement (loss of identity, lack of industry consensus, and the shortage of retailers). The authors conclude by using the findings to consider the future of US fair trade social entrepreneurship. Research limitations/implications – The authors recognize limitations due to the sample size. Practical implications – The authors believe that fair trade is worthy of further study and increased awareness. Social implications – Increased awareness of fair trade may lead to better consumer buying decisions. Originality/value – The authors contribute to the development of theory in the study of fair trade, which has rarely been studied in the context of US social entrepreneurs. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={With the struggle against apartheid achieved, South Africa faced the new struggle of overcoming the HIV/AIDS pandemic. This paper examines the response of government, the innovation system and civil society in rising to the challenge. The response included a fatal denialism concerning the etiology of AIDS, a fatalism that constitutes political market failure. This political market failure was counteracted through the emergence of social entrepreneurship in the form of the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) that mobilized civil society and like-minded health practitioners and researchers within the innovation system. Dependency Theory coupled with a Quadruple Helix model of the innovation system offer possible explanations of this complex human tragedy and the way that government was compelled to embark on a massive program of providing anti-retroviral therapy that has now significantly improved life expectancy. The paper provides socio-economic context, appraisal of the innovation system, and a sketch of how the Quadruple Helix took form. Of special importance is the independence of South Africa’s ‘Republic of Science.’ Independent courts were critical in allowing TAC to obtain remedy against government, Big Pharma, and AIDS dissident scientists. It is argued that its Republic of Science met its obligation of objectivity by shifting emphasis to the cause of AIDS research in the face of official denialism. In effect, the system of innovation and social entrepreneurs are shown to have acted in concert in constituting a Quadruple Helix. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={A formal theory in social entrepreneurship research is required for developing a conceptual framework. Hence, theoretical contributions in the research theme, including social enterprise and social innovation, are currently limited and at an infancy stage. Besides, conceptual contribution in theory building that explains a relational connection between constructs has been less underlined. In fact, only a few number of papers indicated theoretical bases. Social entrepreneurship is the process of classifying a distinct social problem to establish an opportunity as a set of solutions for the addressed problem. It presents an important factor of a continuous innovation for developing entrepreneurial traits in indulging either social need or social good. Innovation is the key theme in social entrepreneurship research, but more effort is required to establish social entrepreneurship-related innovation theory. There are some research gap on social entrepreneurship and social innovation research. Mostly social innovation is associated with initiatives in and by public sector and public-private partnership. This research is emphasized on social innovation process which is initiated in the third sector. In the innovation literature mostly has primarily conceptualized innovation processes as involving the integration of external and internal knowledge. Hence this research propose conceptual model on social innovation process and knowledge integration within. This research integrate construct from the theories of entrepreneurship, innovation and knowledge management. The relation of the three main theories will be proposed in the Knowledge based Social Innovation process conceptual framework. Theoretical contribution in this research is building theory on multi-level of analysis perspective in social innovation process in which contextually introducing the social innovation process within social enterprise. At practical level, this research provide an example on how knowledge management is implemented in the process of innovation for social value creation and utilizing knowledge for social innovation within social enterprise. © 2016 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.},

Can the prefix "social" of social entrepreneurship transform the innate characteristics of entrepreneurship? Is social entrepreneurship an essentiality in a groundbreaking playing field in the business research to facilitate new theories and concepts or a rehash of the corporate responsibility debate? Is it just an appellation or does the underscored social label and its construct allow for new possibility to be explored into the sociality of entrepreneurship along with the new-fangled entrepreneurialism in society? The chapter attempts to decode these more germane and interwoven issues like do we have to tell apart between a capitalist entrepreneurship and a non-capitalist one? Or between pioneering and replicative entrepreneurs. Can we sanctify the political in the social spheres and who (which actors) actually sets the discourse of social needs. The chapter also tracks multiple cases in the Indian locale to determine the robust application of the concept while unpacking the Indian context of social entrepreneurship. These cases are randomly selected from assorted sectors and are wide in its sweep and scope. These cases highlight on the lived experiences, where the task is truly played out.

Whereas the higher education system has been quite successful in providing access to previously excluded groups, the concept of social innovation applied to solving social problems has not yet been integrated into the policies and practices of the university innovation system. The Third Mission of universities is generally interpreted as research and innovation aimed at developing and commercializing technical products rather than supporting more intangible and complex social innovation activities. The universities’ innovation systems for commercial innovations are well developed but organizationally and operationally disconnected from social innovation activities. At the core of this separation of social innovation activities from the work of technology transfer offi ces at universities is the tendency of regarding commercial innovation as organically separated from social innovation. Instead, a model should be adopted that acknowledges that although much of technological innovation is distinctly different in process, aim, and outcome compared to social innovation, there exists a considerable overlap between the two types of innovation. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.},

The most popular are the following areas of business: pre-school education of children; employment support to people being in a difficult life situation; improving the quality and availability of medical services and improving the quality of life of people from socially vulnerable categories of the population. During the development of this topic the main advantages and disadvantages of SMM have been formulated. The stages of construction of the system of promoting a social business project within the framework of SMM are also considered: defining the target segment of consumers within the social media community; compiling the "semantic core" of social group; constructing a mental (intellectual) interaction map within the community in a social network; drawing and realizing a content plan for the efficiency of interaction with customers within a social network; carrying out a statistical analysis of the community; introducing interactive forms of communication with the users for maintaining the communicative constituent of the promotion; monitoring and continuous improving communication within the social network.},

abstract={This study aims to test how legal factors affect the corporate structure of a social enterprise. The current article focuses on the legal factor of governance as the decision-making power of stakeholders within the social enterprise. The authors conducted a case study and examined a major social enterprise (Koinsep) active in Greece. By developing a case study, this article aims to generate theoretical statements about the practical application of the legal factor of governance in the Greek Koinsep as well as a comprehensive understanding of the involvement of stakeholders in the Koinsep's corporate structure. The case study not only demonstrates the relevance of legal provisions and their implementation in the corporate structure when stakeholders are involved in the decision-making process, but it also suggests ways for improving organisational functioning.

abstract={Purpose – The purpose of this article is to show how work-teams are represented and work in non-profit organizations. From a theoretical point of view, the concepts of macro-team and micro-team, as well as their dynamics rooted in the entrepreneurial world have been discussed. Design/methodology/approach – Seven socially enterprising organizations have been studied through semi-structured individual and collective interviews with managers, technicians with and without supervisory functions and workers. Data discussed here underwent an inductive analysis based on the procedures of grounded theory. Findings – Data analysis supported the outlining of the interviewees’ representations of their belonging to the macro-team and of the working of micro-teams. There seem to be no significant differences between the way teams work in these organizations and in profit-making organizations. However, in the organizations we have analyzed, autonomous planning of activities as a mechanism of work organization and assertiveness as a fundamental communication tool between members stand out. Research limitations/implications – This research did not include the systematic observation of work teams in the field. As such, reliability may be somehow compromised due to the use of the individual and group interview as the single data collection technique. Practical implications – The outline of representations that we have designed points to a set of dimensions that shows, with some reliability, how to build a sense of belonging to the macro-team among the workers of this type of organization. It also clarifies the difference between behaviors that foster effective and ineffective micro-teams. This allows action over the latter to potentiate the first and eventually eliminate the second. Originality/value – Considering the scarce research about team-work in non-profit organizations, this study offers a groundbreaking reflection. Further ahead, one may establish a set of differences and similarities between effective macro and micro-teams in different economic sectors. This way, this study may contribute to more encompassing organizational theories focused on the representations about and the functioning of macro and micro-teams. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The social enterprise movement in Lima is gathering momentum. An increasing number of people are taking an interest in this field of activity, in events that help spread the word about its significance, and in a range of initiatives aimed at promoting the phenomenon. In Peru, in general, and in Lima, in particular, there has been a growing interest in promoting the social enterprise movement in recent years, with good results. Young people in particular are more aware of social and environmental issues and look upon enterprises as organisations with the legitimacy and the potential to address these problems. The interest in social enterprises has not, however, been accompanied by the creation of a knowledge base that may help us understand better the peculiarities and complexities of this promising sector. Our article proposes to bridge this gap in knowledge. It is is divided into two sections: (i) definitions; and (ii) operating models for social enterprises. The first section sets out various definitions and interpretations of the term ‘social enterprise’, while the second part provides an empirical account of six different operating models for social enterprises that are active in Lima. Specifically, this part explains the relationship between social enterprises, the market and the intended beneficiaries. We contend that understanding this three-dimensional relationship is essential for developing a credible knowledge base for social enterprises and their value to the wider economy and society. We use qualitative methodology to support our empirical observations. Our extensive review of the literature enables us to draw down three conceptual and practical propositons which we explore through 39 in-depth interviews were held with government officials, social entrepreneurs, academics and representatives of non-governmental, multilateral aid and private-sector organisations related in some way to social enterprises. The study was carried out as part of the ‘International Comparative Social Enterprise Models’ project, financed by the Belgian Science Policy Office in collaboration with the EMES International Research Network. © 2015 SAGE Publications.},

Our aim is to analyse the variables that determine the adoption rate of Solar Home Systems. The analysis is drawn from a qualitative case study in Bangladesh based on interviews, observation and documents. We re-conceptualize diffusion process into three basic components: source, innovation and adopter. In particular, we focus on the characteristics of the source that are specific to the low-income market. In our case, the source is a social entrepreneur who seeks social wealth rather than economic wealth. Our empirical study may help to illuminate diffusion processes conducted by social entrepreneurs at the bottom of the pyramid because it contributes to a more comprehensive list of variables that affect the innovation adoption rate.},

abstract={Entrepreneurship, an emergent field of the relatively new discipline of management, continues to enjoy considerable growing interest. A search for entrepreneurship at the ISI Web of Knowledge reports over 2000 articles published between 2009 and 2010. While the first course in entrepreneurship may have taken place at Harvard Business School only in 1947, today it is taught at nearly every American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) accredited institution, at over 1400 post-secondary schools, and is enjoying considerable worldwide growth (Katz, 2003). Faculty positions continue to increase, as do endowed chairs, and there are now well over 40 peer reviewed journals (Katz, 2003). Governments, municipalities and universities worldwide look toward entrepreneurship as a source of job creation, an engine of economic growth and revitalization, and an answer to issues ranging from demographic constraints to business cycles. It is no wonder that entrepreneurship education has been developed and delivered for groups as diverse as young children, persons with disabilities, and the unemployed, as well as being standard fare for high schools, universities, incubators and professional schools worldwide. For better or for worse, entrepreneurship is often considered the silver bullet to cure social ills, whether they be structural, cultural or material. Entrepreneurship is promoted for activities that include economic development, equity and access, poverty reduction, family business, intrapreneurship, firm growth, community renewal and community development (through the newly expanding field of social entrepreneurship). © Alain Fayolle 2014.},

abstract={While much more breadth in the conceptualization of social entrepreneurship exists in the literature originating from the developed world today, the growth in interest and practice of social enterprise in Lebanon and the Middle East is on the rise. This is mainly due to the opportunities presented by social enterprises for solving the salient social, political and environmental problems that are stifling economic development in this part of the world. Businesses in Lebanon and the region are increasingly integrating sustainable platforms for social and environmental impact into their corporate strategies, in an effort to meet the rising demands for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and social entrepreneurship to address glaring socio-economic ills in their environment. While the social enterprise model is rapidly gaining traction in the region, a framework for establishing a common understanding of these enterprises and how they can succeed has yet to be solidified. If levels of success in social enterprises are not achieved, then their role as change agents in the sphere of economic development risks being compromised. Hence this chapter is largely practical in nature, using established literature on social enterprises to identify the factors that lead to success in the social enterprise landscape, particularly in terms of creating social impact, sustainability and scale. We analyze the social enterprise context in Lebanon and consequently paint a picture of the strengths and shortcomings faced in the local context. These findings are three fold, inherent to the businesses themselves, to the systemic forces within the fabric of Lebanese society and to the nature of the market. Consequently, we formulate recommendations intended to bridge the gaps that today stifle the potential success of social enterprises in Lebanon and compromise potential benefits to society. We draw implications from there that are relevant to the social enterprise discourse in the wider Middle East region. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014.},

abstract={While the Finnish-Russian relations of today cannot be fully understood without understanding the past, it is equally important to know how to break away from it. When discussing cross-border interaction, one must be aware of the broader context within which these processes take place. The territorial sovereignty of the nation-state continues to form one of the leading principles upon which international relations are based, yet transnational relations are increasingly run by actors and organisations whose ability to function does not stop at the border. The Finnish-Russian border provides an illuminating laboratory in which to study border change. This article draws on the experience from this border where cross-border cooperation has reflected both the political and socio-cultural change as well as politically and economically motivated interaction. It argues that the best way to normalise neighbourly relations is through increased people-to-people interaction, and preferable this ought to occur from the bottom-up, not from the top-down. Civil society organisations themselves may need to take matters into their own hands and to seek further revenues through social entrepreneurship in order to ensure the continuity of cooperation. Much of the work is carried out heedless of individual project and programme frames. In practice, its success depends on individual actors who are able to shoulder the implementation of the agreed programs and to solve emerging problems and disagreements.},

This format has emerged as a channel strategy to tackle the issues of growth and financial sustainability social enterprises face, to enhance the alleviation of poverty and to address the need to reduce fiscal deficits and satisfy social needs. We explore the issue of social franchising from a social network theory perspective through case study analyses of four social franchises active in the United Kingdom. We collected data through face-to-face, semi-structured interviews from the owners of the Social Franchisor. We coded the behavior of actors on the four constructs of governance and performance into eight relational norms and classified outcomes as levels of relational embeddedness. Propositions were developed to explain the outcome of each behavior. Our findings indicate that relational embeddedness plays the preeminent role in the design of the governance structure and the performance of social franchises. We learned that the biggest challenges social franchisors face are the creation of a straightforward clear model, the training of the partners to a different operationally-wise and commercially-wise culture and the ability to focus on supporting the whole network. © 2014 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={The idea of Rang De was sown by the husband and wife duo Ramakrishna NK and Smita Ram in the year 2006, the same year in which Muhammad Yunus was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his pioneering work with Grameen Bank in Bangladesh. The website, http://www.Rangde.org was finally launched and went live on 26 January 2008. The entry of Rang De was at a time when the microfinance sector in India was reeling under the pressure of higher interest rate nearly 26% on account of higher operating cost. Rang De, the peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platform created a cult by offering a flat interest rate of 8.5% p.a. on microloans offered for a period of normally, one to two years. Since its launch in 2008, the growth of Rang De has been very impressive. Rang De is one such classic example which has proved how the power of social media can be leveraged for social good. This case traces the inspiring story of Rang De and aims to highlight the success of this innovative model of micro lending in India. The case further explores the challenges which Rang De faces in terms of acceptability, marketing, outreach and sustainability. Copyright © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={Interest in social entrepreneurship is growing widely not only in Brazil but in the world. Several developed countries have stepped forward to develop policies to support this area not only as a tool to fulfill the government failures such as poverty, health, education, unemployment among others, but also because of all the benefits that social enterprises have in relation to society. However, it is possible to identify a lack of political support for social entrepreneurship in Brazil. Given the needs in the Brazilian context of improvements in several areas where the state can not cover actions in their entirety as social exclusion, income distribution and especially professionalization of youth and creating jobs, we need a deep analysis of how social entrepreneurship can act as a modifying element of this scenario. Thus, with Brazil a country developing rapidly, it is important to verify public policies that support social entrepreneurship in already developed countries and carry out studies on the suitability and applicability of these policies in the Brazilian reality. Thus, this paper aims to study the trends of social entrepreneurship in some developed countries as well as analyzing public policies implemented by these countries, and considering the Brazilian context, present some policy proposals to support social entrepreneurship in Brazil. © Universidad Alberto Hurtado, Facultad de Economía y Negocios.},

The purpose of this study is to examine whether the widely accepted motivational factors influencing entrepreneurial process have similar influence on social entrepreneurs in Bangladesh. Based on the seminal work of Shane et al. (2003) on entrepreneurial motivation, a survey was conducted among the social entrepreneurs in Bangladesh and collected data was analyzed. A regression analysis shows that some of widely accepted factors have significant influence while others have less or non-significant influence on Bangladeshi social entrepreneurs.

The current initiatives of social economy are a response to the welfare state crisis, new social risks and the crisis of employed society. The definition of social economy comes from research activities of the European research net EMES and the Said Business School of Oxford University. The author's effort is focused on identifying the main assumptions for establishing these social innovations. The conclusion focuses on allocating opportunities for social entrepreneurship in the public sphere and public policies in Slovakia (employment policy, social inclusion policy, local social development, the delivering of public and social services, and civic participation).},

In view of the challenge of choosing entrepreneurship, analyses are performed on women's motivations to become entrepreneurs, on the consequences of this choice, as well as on the difficulties faced by women entrepreneurs and the strategies they use to cope with different demands linked to the multiplicity of gender roles. The examination of leadership characteristics of women entrepreneurs reveals that they tend to build social networks and to use their power with others and not over others. Furthermore, it becomes evident that women social entrepreneurs in charge of their social ventures, while exercising their power on behalf of women, aim to empower them and promote their social and professional inclusion thus causing significant social, economical and cultural changes.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to document the manner in which a pro-poor company can deliver ongoing health benefits and improve environmental sustainability in a manner that addresses child and maternal mortality (in line with millennium development goals 4, 5 and 7). Design/methodology/approach: Field research in Mozambique including 12 in-depth interviews with key personnel from December 2006 to January 2007. Findings: First, clear threats to the success of VidaGás' pro-poor business model encompass insufficient liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) supply and storage facilities; poor industrial and commercial infrastructure in Northern Mozambique; inadequate training of retailers in LPG use; and inadequate consumer knowledge of the benefits of LPG. Second, key innovations employed by VidaGás to overcome these obstacles consist of the introduction of a novel cold chain to safeguard medicines; a complex supply chain to ensure timely delivery; and the exploitation of local knowledge and expertise to expand the uptake of LPG by Mozambicans. Practical implications: The case study focuses on a business problem with significant development implications. The challenge is to ensure a reliable supply of LPG in Northern Mozambique. To meet this challenge, VidaGás must achieve its stated goal of becoming a revenue-generating entity within three years. In order to create a viable market for LPG, VidaGás must not only increase the uptake of LPG by poor consumers, it must expand LPG market access to commercial consumers, while raising additional capital. Originality/value: The paper contributes to the literature on social entrepreneurship and demonstrates how to link for-profit business imperatives with development goals. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Entrepreneurship as a manifestation of change is vital in terms of jobs and business dynamism. However, entrepreneurship as a social activity occurs in time and space and is seen as a natural, organic process. We assume this change will occur naturally, but this can be interrupted by planned change. This observational study examines the influence of socio-cultural factors on the evolution of community-based entrepreneurial activity in an urban village setting using the social metrics of home, habitus and habituation to examine how this activity develops within a planned monocultural middle class enclave. Studying social entrepreneurship in a fixed social setting permits us to investigate the embededdness of the entrepreneurial process in a naturally occurring environment. When the natural order is interrupted, entrepreneurial activity becomes disjointed and finds new avenues of emergence as community-based entrepreneurial activity in which business is facilitated by social networking and entrepreneurial identity is socially constructed through play.

abstract={Introduction “Business as usual” has come under intense scrutiny. Public outrage over crooked corporate officers, the looting of pension funds, the defrauding of stockholders, and the wholesale firings of hardworking employees has reached a new high (see e.g. Jackson and Nelson 2004; Pirson 2007). Not only the anti-globalization movement of the far left but also more traditional thinkers and the public are increasingly uncomfortable with corporate power and influence. In September 2000 (even before Enron's collapse), over 70 percent of Americans surveyed said that business had too much power over too many aspects of their lives and too much political influence. Only 4 percent agreed that companies should have only one purpose, namely to make the most profit for shareholders. Ninety-five percent agreed that American corporations should have more than one purpose and, additionally, that they owe something to their workers and the communities in which they operate (Bernstein 2000; Paine 2003). International surveys on trust in corporations also demonstrate that trust in big business continues to decrease. According to GlobeScan (World Economic Forum 2006), in 2006, trust in multinational and global companies reached its all-time low. In the eyes of bestselling author William Greider (2003), the avatars of capitalism are meeting deeply rooted anger and are blamed for the erosion of family life, the decreased sense of personal and professional security, corroded communities, impoverished spiritual lives, and a devastated natural environment. Overall, the criticism leveled at current capitalism is that it fails to be life-conducive. © Cambridge University Press 2009.},

abstract={It may take up to two decades before research findings become routinely used in clinical practice (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2001). Librarians are uniquely positioned to maximize the accessibility of research. The author believes that research about gender biology and gender medicine needs to be integrated into clinical practice sooner than later, and that librarians can play a key role in connecting users with research. Utilizing the entrepreneurial approaches, techniques, methods, strategies, and tactics that are used for packaging and promoting their information products and services for social purpose, librarians can become social entrepreneurs. GenderBiology.net, a gateway to news and resources about gender biology and gender medicine, was created to assist information and health care professionals and consumers in this endeavor (Allison, 2006). This article provides an introduction to gender biology and medicine with selected events leading up to the concept of gender-specific medicine, as well as specific ways that librarians can become important players in getting genderspecific biomedical research information translated to real world application. © 2007 The Board of Trustees.},

(2) Should social work educators engage in teaching the theory and practice of social entrepreneurship and, if so, how might this be developed? In addressing these questions, the authors focus on an initiative arising from current research being undertaken jointly between the Department of Social Work at the University of Newcastle and the Newcastle and Hunter Chamber of Business. (Newcastle is a large regional centre on the east coast of New South Wales, Australia.) The research explores the nature of business and social sector relationships at the local level. The particular initiative arising from the networks established through business research is to develop short courses in social entrepreneurship in partnership with the University's Graduate School of Business. As social work educators contributing to social entrepreneurship education programmes in partnership with business educators, our challenge is to ensure that the social mission of social entrepreneurship remains central and its implications are fully understood and explored.},

abstract={This article deals with the management problems of the traditional welfare state. The article is based on observations and interviews with employees in the home-help service for the elderly in Valby, a suburb of Copenhagen. On the basis of observations and interviews, and with reference to various relevant studies, the history of home-help in Denmark is examined as a "narrative" in order to uncover critical problems and incidents. In Valby an attempt has been made to promote flexibility and interaction with clients, rather than a standardisation of the services offered. The practical expression of this approach can be seen in the shape of a new entrepreneurial role in management, what I call the social entrepreneur. I discuss briefly how support for this new role can be institutionalised. At the theoretical level, I analyse the Valby case using the theory of flexible specialisation. However, the Valby case illustrates the contextual limitations of this theory and the need to complement the approach with an understanding of management problems at the practical level. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

We find that distinctiveness in men's campaigns is associated with faster funding. Conversely, when women's campaigns are distinctive from other women, funding times vary depending on their sector. Our findings suggest that in prosocial microlending, deviating from the normal narrative of one's gender is advantageous for campaigns led by men, but that among women, it can often hinder prosocial microlending efforts. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Purpose: Building on construal level theory (CLT), this study explores mental representations of entrepreneurial intentions (EIs) with different foci (i.e. social and commercial) among university students from Generations Y and Z. Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of university students from the United States contacted through the Entrepreneurship Education Project, this study employs a configurational perspective—fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA)—to identify the pathways leading to EIs and social entrepreneurial intentions (SEIs). Findings: Results show that the configurations of conditions leading to the outcomes (EI and SEI) are not disparate but share far more similarities even when considering socially oriented antecedents, supporting the claim that students perceive both EIs with different foci as high-level construals. The results also demonstrate no differences within gender, but there are asymmetries between gender in the configurations leading to EI and SEI. Research limitations/implications: This study contributes to EI literature by providing new insights into understanding how individuals perceive EIs at an early stage of entrepreneurship and by bringing CLT to the EI literature. Practical implications: These results have implications for entrepreneurship education and practice, as it recognizes that students' EIs are psychologically distant, lacking a level of detail and specificity. This would explain why students do not immediately create ventures, but that entrepreneurship has a certain incubation time to create an entrepreneurial mindset. Originality/value: Exploring the configurational approaches can help to uncover the complexity and idiosyncrasies underlying EIs. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: This study aims to illuminate the field conditions under which social entrepreneurship can become institutionalized and transform the existing institutional fields. Design/methodology/approach: A comparative case study was conducted among three social enterprises, within different regional institutional fields, following a most different systems design: OTELO, in Mühlviertel, ADC MOURA, in Baixo Alentejo and STEVIA HELLAS in Phthiotis. Findings: The results indicate some of the field conditions under which an institutionalization of social entrepreneurship can thrive, namely, a high civil approval, a highly institutionalized and decentralized institutional field that allows the social enterprise to remain autonomous, as well the anchoring of the venture to a pre-existing counter-hegemonic narrative or/and to an embedded network that drives the dissemination a new institutional logic forward. Research limitations/implications: The institutionalization of the voluntary collective action that social entrepreneurship embodies has significant limitations. The same is true for innovation, which tends to lose its innovative spirit as it becomes institutionalized. Future research has to explore if institutionalized social entrepreneurship can maintain a voluntary perspective and an innovative drift. Originality/value: Most studies on institutional entrepreneurship deploy in-depth case studies while multi-case comparative research remains rare. The current comparative study adds significantly to the understanding of institutional entrepreneurship, as it compares different degrees of institutionalization and successful institutional entrepreneurs to non-successful ones. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Social entrepreneurship (SE) is an emerging research field that has received much scholarly attention in recent years. Given the global scope of this attention, this review explores the existing scientific literature on social entrepreneurship to contribute to a systematization of the research field. Based on the publications in Web of Science and Scopus, a total of 1425 scientific articles were analyzed. We used the bibliometric method to describe the evolution of social entrepreneurship research (e.g., evaluation by years, authors, scientific journal articles, and countries in the SE literature that have had the greatest impact in terms of production). In addition, we used the mapping of knowledge networks through the citations and co-citations analysis to identify schools of thought. A keyword co-occurrence analysis was performed to detect key research topics over the years. The results show that, although the research is still in a nascent phase, it has a multidisciplinary character. Furthermore, social entrepreneurship appears to be a concept closely linked to three schools of thought: Commercial entrepreneurship, sustainable entrepreneurship, and social innovation. The keywords analysis allowed us to isolate the constructs that the literature has considered antecedents (e.g., socio-psychological factors) and accelerators (e.g., education, network, culture, and gender) to the development of social entrepreneurial intention. We will further discuss the ways researchers can explore this research field and contribute to the global literature. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Despite a broad consensus that it is a desirable method for addressing social and environmental problems, I argue it may instead have a negative societal impact as it reduces the pressure for ambitious legislation and institutional reforms that have more scope to effect change. Social entrepreneurs themselves are prone to a form of ‘solutionism’ in which they believe complex social problems can be addressed neatly through the apparatus of the entrepreneur, something I argue is ineffectual and inappropriate for tackling many of the deep-seated and essentially ‘public’ structural problems we face. I offer some suggestions as to how researchers can provide some critical balance to theories of social entrepreneurship, specifically through better demarcating when social entrepreneurship is an optimal mechanism for addressing social problems, and when public policy may be preferable. © 2020 Society for the Advancement of Management Studies and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

Results of the revised Hockerts' model observe direct positive effects of perceived social support and social responsibility on SEI, whereas results of the alternative model suggest that social entrepreneurial self-efficacy and outcome expectations act as critical mediators on SEI. This study also demonstrates that extrinsic reward moderates the relationship between outcome expectations and SEI.

abstract={Social entrepreneurship has recently become a much‐desired area of research for academia, practices, and policymaking. Natural or cognitive personal thoughtfulness like loving-kindness meditation (LKM) and compassion trigger individual intentions towards the social entrepreneurial venture. In this process of individual social entrepreneurial intention personality trait plays a very vital role, such as entrepreneurship resilience. For this study, a purposive sampling technique was incorporated and data was collected from 631 business and management sciences students. Data is analyzed by SPSS 23 and for the hypothesis testing, we used the bootstrap analysis of Hayes PROCESS v3.5. This study depicts that LKM has a positive significant impact on compassion and no significant impact on social entrepreneurship intentions while resilience strengthens the direct relationship of compassion with social entrepreneurship and the indirect relationship of LKM with social entrepreneurship via compassion. This study contributes to solving the economic and social problems over the globe especially by boosting the LKM and resilience traits so that the young graduate commence social entrepreneurship.

abstract={Paradox theory is attracting increasing interest from entrepreneurship scholars seeking to understand how entrepreneurs who operate hybrid organizations such as prosocial ventures can effectively address grand challenges. The organizational paradox literature suggests that differences in actors' approach to paradoxes can occur through the acquisition of different reasoning styles through exposure to different national cultures and cultural resources. We complement the paradox research stream on culture as a resource with the alternative perspective of culture as an experience, which we argue offers additional insight into hybridity within a global context because intercultural experiences are intrinsically paradoxical. Our 18 case studies of immigrant entrepreneurs from the African diaspora operating their prosocial ventures in Western contexts finds that the ways that immigrant entrepreneurs approach tensions in their prosocial ventures mirrors the nature of their intercultural experience. We also find that approaches to paradox vary based on structural barriers such as social exclusion that entrepreneurs faced in their formative years. Overall, our study contributes to research on culture in paradox theory and the prosocial venturing literature by elucidating how entrepreneurs' intercultural experience and the global macro-level systems in which it is embedded inform the degree and configurations of hybridity in prosocial ventures. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

If the crowding-out effect exists, is it because of donors’ reactions to nonprofit commercialization or nonprofits’ decisions to reduce efforts in fundraising? Using data from the National Center for Charitable Statistics on human service nonprofit organizations in the USA, this study examines the relationship between commercial revenues and donations, breaking the relationship into smaller parts to understand its composition. The results show that commercial revenues crowd out donations in human service organizations. An increase in 1 dollar of commercial revenues leads to a decrease in.14 dollar of donations. Up to 16% of the crowding-out effect is attributable to nonprofit organizations’ reducing fundraising activities. The crowding-out effect is not merely due to donors’ reactions to nonprofit commercialization. © 2020, International Society for Third-Sector Research.},

abstract={Founders of hybrid ventures encounter organizational tensions that can compel compromise in both their organizations' and their own personal values. Such compromises may, in turn, undermine founders' identification with their ventures. In a multi-case study analysis we examine why social entrepreneurs differ in their responses to organizational tensions, both at the firm- and individual-level, and how such differences relate to their venture identification. Specifically, our findings reveal that strategic decisions made in the context of values-based complexity are often accompanied by concerns regarding founder authenticity—that is, judgments about the alignment between founders' actions and the commitments or responsibilities associated with their identities as entrepreneurs. Yet, because founders differ in the basis from which they seek to maintain such alignment, these differences shape both hybridity management and subsequent venture identification. By unpacking such differences, our findings contribute new theory, bridging recent scholarship on founder authenticity with longstanding research on organizational identification and hybrid organizing. © 2020},

Based on an in-depth, qualitative study with work integration social enterprises in the secondhand clothes industry, we uncover the dynamics of simultaneous cooperation and competition. Our analysis shows that social enterprises simultaneously—rather than sequentially—engage in coopetitive actions at three levels of action: operational, stakeholder, and environmental interface. At each level, social enterprises engage in different coopetitive actions that do not easily fall under the commercial–social tension usually studied in the social entrepreneurship literature. Social and economic goals motivate both competition and cooperation, but we argue that this plays out differently at each level of coopetition. We conclude with implications for theory and practice. © The Author(s) 2020.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to determine the factors that affect Islamic entrepreneurial intentions. Specifically, how do prior experience, empathy, moral obligation, self-efficacy and perceived behavioral support affect entrepreneurial intentions based on Islamic principles? Design/methodology/approach: To answer this question, three theoretical frameworks using the theory of planned behavior (TPB), the theory of bounded rational planned behavior (TBRPB) and the theory of social entrepreneurship as its basis were established. Using measurement scales created to assess different aspects of the constructs, a survey instrument was developed to test the various relationships implied by those frameworks. Findings: The findings of the study revealed that among the five factors prior experience and self-efficacy are the most important factors to affect Islamic entrepreneurial intentions. Research limitations/implications: From a research perspective, the study results establish the robustness of the TPB, TBRPB and the social entrepreneurial intention model for helping to explain Islamic entrepreneurial intention behavior. Practical implications: The practical implications of these results suggest that efforts aimed at increasing Islamic entrepreneurial activity may want to consider the variables studied in this paper. Both interested policymakers and academics cherishing to encourage Islamic, as well as conventional entrepreneurial activity, can take away that Islamic entrepreneurial self-efficacy and prior experience are deemed to be the most important measures. Social implications: The findings from this paper suggest that the organizations could tend to promote Islamic entrepreneurial intentions in society through a special emphasis on the antecedents discussed in this paper. Originality/value: It is vital to keep in mind that the measure for Islamic entrepreneurial self-efficacy used in this study differed from the usual constructs for self-efficacy. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Social entrepreneurship is a field widely explored from multiple perspectives and within multiple academic disciplines. In parallel, practitioners have applied social entrepreneurship principles to multiple sectors and on multiple levels. This research investigates how social capital applied to social entrepreneurship can contribute as a driver of social enterprise. A systematic literature review was conducted based on searches of major academic databases (Web of Science, Ebsco and Periódicos Capes), winnowing an initial list of 3,106 papers down to 472 articles that underwent content analysis. The results of this analysis were summarised and used to develop a theoretical proposal and research propositions relating social entrepreneurship to social capital and highlighting the social entrepreneur’s social connections with the collective actors and institutions that together constitute social entrepreneurship. The discussion presented suggests that the interface between social entrepreneurship and social capital is a latent field for research and the paper ends by presenting a model to consolidate research efforts, identifying three key themes that recur in the literature: Creation of social capital by the social entrepreneur, social capital and its relationship with the institutions, and Social capital as a former of groups. In these terms, a future agenda is presented for debating these issues. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Purpose: This study presents a framework for integrating distinct perspectives on social entrepreneurship by combining institutional theory with the social entrepreneurship intention model. The framework assesses the relationships between social support and the perceived feasibility and desirability of social entrepreneurship, the relationships between social support and the institutional environments of social workers, and the moderating role of prior experience of social work and volunteering. Design/methodology/approach: The model was tested using 266 validated responses from an online and paper-based survey distributed among social workers. Partial least squares structural equation modelling was used to analyse the data, and multi-group analysis was conducted to examine the moderation effects. Findings: The findings indicate that experience moderates the relationships between the regulatory and cognitive environments, cognitive environments and social support, and social support and perceived feasibility. Experience negatively moderates the relationship between the normative environment and social support. Practical implications: Active government involvement in the form of incentives and financial support would encourage the creation of social ventures. Social implications: Educational programmes are also necessary to help raise awareness and increase the familiarity and knowledge of potential social entrepreneurs. Originality/value: The study analyses the effects of institutional environmental components, recognised as highly influential on the development of social entrepreneurship, as well as the impact of perceived social support on the antecedents of the perceived desirability and feasibility of social entrepreneurship. It also addresses how social work experience modifies these relationships. Contrary to previous studies, the findings suggest that increasing social work experience isolates entrepreneurs from their environment. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: This study aims to investigate whether big data enabling (BDE) and empowerment-focused human resource management (EHRM) can effectively promote employee intrapreneurship and their effects on platform enterprises’ innovation performance. The paper also examines the contexts under which employee intrapreneurship may affect business performance. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 155 platform enterprises in China in the form of questionnaires. Participants were mainly middle and senior managers with a comprehensive grasp of the enterprises’ information. Findings: The results indicated that BDE, EHRM and their synergy positively influenced employee intrapreneurship, which could potentially extend to enterprise performance. Specifically, employee intrapreneurship played a partial mediating role between BDE, EHRM and performance, and a whole mediating role between synergy and performance. Finally, platform strategic flexibility played a positive moderating role between employee intrapreneurship and performance. Practical implications: Platform enterprises should focus on the construction and utilization of big data and EHRM to stimulate organizational vitality. They also need to encourage employees to start businesses and build more flexible strategies to adapt to the dynamic economic environment. Originality/value: This is an empirical study on the effect mechanism of big data and HRM on employee intrapreneurship and platform enterprises’ performance in China. The paper combined big data, HRM and employee intrapreneurship, which broke through the previous research on enterprise entrepreneurship and social entrepreneurship.

The analysis of the selected texts allowed categorizing the entrepreneurship articles into subthemes: precursors of entrepreneurship, intention/orientation of entrepreneurship, different perspectives of entrepreneurship in sport and social entrepreneurship in sport. Of the 49 texts included in the review, only seven articles dealt with intrapreneurship, and they could not be classified into subtopics because the studies are scarce, diverse and with disparate themes. Findings: The main findings show deficiencies in research on precursors/antecedents of entrepreneurial and intrapreneurial behavior, especially in relation to innovation, the importance of the political perspective on entrepreneurship in sport and formulation of behavior training programs for intrapreneurs. Originality/value: This paper provides valuable and global information about entrepreneurship and intrapreneurship in sport, of which there were scattered or grouped data in some reviews. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={In the Netherlands, there is a growing need for collective housing for older people to bridge the gap between ageing-in-place and institutional care facilities. Participation of older people in the concept and design phases is important to tune the market supply to the needs of (future) residents, yet social entrepreneurs find it challenging to involve older people. This commentary explores various ways older people can participate in the development of new housing initiatives. The ladder of citizen participation is applied to explore different roles that (future) residents could play with levels of influence varying from non-participation to citizen power. Considerations for meaningful participation are discussed, in order to show how collaborations can be formed between (future) residents and decision makers. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={While much research has been devoted to the study of how social entrepreneurs manage social-business tensions inherent when pursuing dual missions, we know very little on what determines the ways that they address this challenge. Building on Fauchart and Gruber’s classification of three pure types of entrepreneurial social identities, this study applies a qualitative approach to explore the interplay between entrepreneurial identity and the handling of social-business tensions. The aim of the study is twofold: first, to identify social entrepreneurs’ self-perceived identity, and second, to explore its potential relationship with social-business tensions. Findings reveal that social entrepreneurs exhibit hybrid identities of all three pure identity types. In handling social business tensions, however, they tend to develop new meta-role identities, acting as intermediaries between their organisations and the market, and between actors from different sectors. Additionally, the study identified push and pull factors, which play a role in the gradual process of self-perceived identity modification. These findings offer fresh insights into the entrepreneurial identity and social entrepreneurship literature and expand our understanding of the micro-foundations of social entrepreneurs’ managerial choices. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Specifically, how do empathy, moral obligation, self-efficacy and perceived social support influence Islamic social entrepreneurial intentions through the mediation of prior experience of individual? To answer this question, a theoretical framework using the theory of social entrepreneurial intentions provided (TSEI) by Mair and Noboa as its basis was established. Using measurement scales created to assess different aspects of the constructs, a survey instrument was developed to test the various relationships implied by ISEI. Data (n = 249) were collected following random sampling procedure from a business school at a private university in Bangladesh. Data were analysed using the procedure of structural equation modelling. Findings show that prior experience both directly and indirectly predicts Islamic social entrepreneurial intentions. Entrepreneurial self-efficacy has both the largest impact on intentions as well as on prior experience. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Purpose: This study aims to identify the main factors of knowledge assets (i.e., human, relational and structural capital) that affect the value creation process of social enterprises located in East and West Africa. Design: A survey was administered to a sample of social enterprises located in developing countries such as Kenya, Uganda, Sierra Leone and Ghana. The survey was designed to gather background information about social enterprises, social entrepreneurs as well as data pertaining to intellectual capital. Therefore, descriptive statistical analysis, principal component analysis and Pearson correlations were employed to identify the main components of IC for African SEs and the inter-relationship among intellectual capital components. Findings: Research findings confirmed that human capital (i.e., a social entrepreneur's knowledge), relational capital (i.e., local and global relationship quality) and structural capital (i.e., long-term and up-to-date firm knowledge) were validated as important resources for African SEs in the value creation process. Moreover, correlation analysis showed that human capital and relational capital were positively correlated; whereas structural capital was positively correlated with the local and global relationship's quality and with the social entrepreneur's skills. Limitations: The main limitations concern the heterogeneity and the restricted sample size due to challenges in the data gathering process. Moreover, the results could potentially be influenced by the context and the low response rate. However, this study can represent a starting point for future research in this unique but important research setting. Originality: This study can be considered original for several reasons. First, empirical evidence on knowledge assets in developing countries in Africa is still scarce, despite the potential of being a new frontier for intellectual capital studies and social and economic growth. Second, the use of a survey method as an IC measurement tool in this context is unique. Finally, this study helps in providing a platform for further investigation in Africa. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={Social entrepreneurs are driven to solve a particular social problem. Yet, they operate in a broad universe of stakeholders that expect the organization to at least not worsen a range of social ills. This complicates the organization’s work as various social goals can be in tension with each other. Based on Instrumental Stakeholder Theory and the concept of organizational fitness, this paper uses a revelatory case study to explore the unique stakeholder management challenges faced by social entrepreneurs. A series of nine interviews and review of archival materials reveals how Berkshares, Inc., a creator of a local currency, had to contend with competing social issues important to an array of stakeholders. The study showed that competing views of different social issues from different stakeholders in the community had a substantial impact on the management of the organization. Two primary points emerged from the data. First, the need to manage these competing dimensions greatly complicates organizational goal setting and initiative selection, potentially creating internal conflict and making decisions easily contested. Second, this challenge alters the nature of the transition from startup to maturity, such that marketing and external communication became much more critical for maintaining stakeholder support as the venture grew. © 2019 Journal of the Canadian Council for Small Business and Entrepreneurship/Conseil de la PME et de l’entrepreneuriat.},

abstract={Building on the active aging framework, the aim of this study, carried out between 2016 and 2018, is to analyze concrete experiences of older individuals acting as key players of social change in six local communities of five European countries (Bulgaria, Denmark, England, France, Spain). The 19 seniors involved in the study, according to social contexts, individual past experiences, knowledge, and motivations, acted as senior social entrepreneurs, trying to build a pathway towards social solutions for unmet social problems they detected in local communities. Data were collected via templates and questionnaires and analyzed using the thematic analysis. The results highlighted that the 16 local initiatives created by seniors concerned social problems such as food waste, social isolation, multicultural integration, etc. The social solutions implemented by seniors seemed to have the potential to produce social value and, to different degrees, encouraging results and impact. Since this “social experiment” provided evidence that senior social entrepreneuring could be a driver to solve societal problems, policy makers should sustain the spread of both social entrepreneurial mindset and practices at the European level, for catalyzing the active potential of older people for the benefit of European local communities. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={In practice, development too often neglects the perspective of the impoverished when attempting to ameliorate negative socioeconomic conditions that persist. Entrepreneurs, and in particular social entrepreneurs, often attempt to solve social issues through a triple-bottom line approach but in many cases focus on the problem without greater consideration to the cultural context of their intervention. We introduce a new term, transcultural development, to advocate for the inclusion and preservation of cultural norms and rights of receiving cultures in the face of globalization, particularly when conducting projects that attempt to alleviate poverty. Presented is an applied ethnographic study conducted by two faculty members and seven undergraduate students consulting for a non-governmental organization (NGO) social enterprise over a ten-day short-term study abroad trip. The NGO and student group aimed to assist impoverished Guatemalans inhabiting the southwestern coastal plain to develop a new export crop, the pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan). Gender norms and rights proved a focal point in demonstrating the importance of conducting social impact assessments regularly to mitigate entrenched or biased views. The transcultural development approach may optimally incorporate an applied anthropological lens to the social aspects of social entrepreneurship.

abstract={Entrepreneurship's training is an issue with many gaps—even with contradictory results—, in which many aspects and the relationships between them are still unknown. This paper addresses the relationships that exist in training process and on their impact on the resultant entrepreneurial capacity. The sample includes 469 individuals interested in starting a new venture. A common method bias was addressed on the questionnaire design including psychological separation of predictor and criterion variables and response anonymity. Furthermore, a principal factor analysis on the questionnaire measurement items was carried out, without a single factor emerging. The statistical analysis was carried out by ordinal logistic regression and multinomial logistic regression. The results obtained are not a trivial issue for entrepreneurship, but rather a key aspect, which must be very present in the training stages of the entrepreneur. In fact, the emerging entrepreneur requires training in areas or capacities that complement and reinforce entrepreneurship capacity, combines different essential ingredients for entrepreneurship, and is adapted to increases in entrepreneurship capacity. Innovation and business ethics contribute to any kind of entrepreneurship and they make a net contribution to the entrepreneurial capacity and in any entrepreneurial process. Finally, innovation and ethical commitment are more critical for obtaining a high level of entrepreneurial capacity, and they are important for entrepreneurship in general, outside social entrepreneurship and innovative entrepreneurship. © 2019, Eurasia Business and Economics Society.},

abstract={The main aim of the paper is to provide evidence that merging the corporate social responsibility (CSR), the leadership, and the social entrepreneurship literatures informs and benefit all these literatures. With this aim, a literature review on the studies investigating how leaders affect organizational CSR, why organizations engage in CSR, and how the environment affects the leader and the organizational CSR approach has been carried out. The outcome is a microfocused, multilevel, and multitheoretical conceptual framework, able to underline the links between the role of the leader, the organizational CSR approach, and the sustainable development of the territory. The conceptual framework has been applied to the GOEL case study, a strategic alliance operating in an unfavorable context. The findings provide evidence of the pivotal role of the leader in defining the organizational CSR approach and that the societal and cultural contexts affect the way in which leader faces the sustainability challenges. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment},

abstract={Hybrid organizations face particular challenges and opportunities due to combining different logics within one organizational structure. While research on hybrid organizing has advanced considerably our understanding of how these organizations can cope with such tensions, institutional theory suggests that organizational legitimacy and success will also depend on processes that take place at the field level. We connect these two perspectives to examine how field hybridity influences organizational legitimacy. Specifically, we consider both a field’s maturity and its degree of hybridity as two important variables that determine the effects that field hybridity has on organizational legitimacy. Drawing from extant research and leveraging our empirical work in the fields of microfinance, social entrepreneurship and impact investing to provide illustrative examples, we propose a framework that considers both positive and negative effects of field hybridity on organizational legitimacy. We contribute to the literature on hybrid organizing in two ways. First, we show that hybrid organizations face different challenges and opportunities depending on the stage of development and degree of hybridity of the field they operate in. Second, we suggest that the effects of field hybridity on organizational legitimacy can be understood as trade-offs that organizations need to understand and approach strategically to leverage opportunities and mitigate challenges. © 2020 by Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={This study investigates the relationship between social enterprises' social orientation and the organizational commitment of their employees. The study also examines differences in organizational commitment between Millennial social enterprise employees and social enterprise employees of earlier generations. The findings from the study indicate that a social enterprise's pursuit of social purpose, shared decision-making, and social performance are all positively associated with the organizational commitment of its employees. Additionally, the findings suggest that, in general, Millennials have a lower level of organizational commitment to their social enterprise employer than do earlier generations. Indeed, the organizational commitment of Millennials, we find, is primarily (and significantly) influenced only by shared decision-making. These findings contribute to the literature on social enterprise as well as to the literature on organizational commitment by providing insight into unseen aspects of social enterprise management from the perspective of employees. From a practical standpoint, these findings provide social entrepreneurs and managers of social enterprises with practical guidance on how to improve their employees' organizational commitment. © 2020 Midwest Public Affairs Conference.

abstract={The definition of "entrepreneurship" briefly stands for setting up a new business by taking financial and other risks to gain profits. Phenomenon of "social entrepreneurship" has emerged as a follow up concept of entrepreneurship, as a critical issue in the context of both improvement and wellbeing of societies. Social entrepreneurship focuses on social problems rather than profit maximization and is especially important for gastronomy tourism due to the social local benefits as cultural integration and employment it brings. In order to understand the promising research areas and explore the research gap in the gastronomical social entrepreneurship applications, bibliometric analysis is chosen since studies are limited in the gastronomy tourism as well as social entrepreneurship. The research in subject area consisted on keywords that are used as search items for articles title section to select articles that are more accurate for the aim of the research. The analysis shows that there are 20 articles with the combination of related key word variations. When the methodologies of the related articles is analyzed, it is understood that qualitative research with multiple and comparative case study is chosen for almost all the related articles. The reason might be due to the characteristics of the research topic and novelty, thus, rarity of true to life gastronomical social innovation applications. Th is study is expected to guide future studies by providing general overview of the studies and the research gap in social entrepreneurship and gastronomy tourism. © 2020 Institute for Tourism.

abstract={The most appropriate type of entrepreneurship to achieve the goals of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) is social entrepreneurship (SE). However, the NGOs face many barriers in their SE that should be studied. Therefore, the main purpose of this study was to assess the barriers to development of SE in NGOs of Kermanshah province in Western Iran using a qualitative paradigm along with the method of grounded theory. Using purposeful and theoretical sampling, 12 cases were selected. The techniques used for data collection were open questionnaires (unstructured), individual depth interviews, and taking notes. The findings showed that the most important barriers to the development of SE in NGOs of Kermanshah province include cultural-social, economic, educational, infrastructure, communication-information, management, psychological, legal-policy, and supportive barriers. These barriers have resulted in the phenomenon of SE underdevelopment among NGOs of Kermanshah province. Moreover, these barriers have played a major role in the failure of the process of solving the social problems of the province of Kermanshah, which eventually has led to the underdevelopment of its status. These barriers should be controlled, adjusted, or even eliminated. Finally, based on the findings and in order to overcome these barriers, some recommendations were presented. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to develop a model of “electronic social entrepreneurship” by integrating social entrepreneurship and information and communication technology to enhance social enterprise effectiveness. Social enterprise has recently emerged as a contemporary form of enterprise to achieve sustainable social order. Thus, besides building economic value, a primary goal of these enterprises is to create superior social value. Although, a considerable number of studies exist on social enterprise, the literature is still lacking in the discussion on electronic social entrepreneurship. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopted inductive qualitative approach in which in-depth, semistructured interviews were conducted from 32 owners/managers/CEOs of registered social enterprises. Findings: The analysis of interviews by qualified researchers resulted in the identification of four key themes. These themes included information and communication technology, information and communication technology–based innovation, environmental complexity and social value creation. Frequencies of all the identified themes were calculated, and based on these themes, literature review was conducted to find out the relationships between these themes and to introduce a model of electronic social entrepreneurship. Practical implications: The model developed could be used by social enterprises for achieving higher social and economic returns. Originality/value: Based on interviews and literature review, a unique model for electronic social entrepreneurship is developed. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

When demand ceased to exist, many public buildings were underused or abandoned. Sometimes with illegality forms of employment tolerated by the owner administrations, sometimes with the more or less support of public authorities, communities of various kinds have found in the public assets the place to create new forms of social and economic organization offering hospitality to new formations of urban life, associations and social entrepreneurs capable of economic and social innovation whose collective benefits concern the city as a whole.

In order to realise it‘s aim, the present research adopts a qualitative case study approach to understand the social innovations adopted by social enterprises for environmental sustainability. For the present study, three successful social enterprises in Gujarat were selected by using purposive sampling and in-depth interviews were conducted. The selected social enterprises have all been in operation for an extensive period and have acquired significant recognition for their contribution in achieving sustainable social change at local, national and international level. The cases are “Ekam Eco Solutions”, “Let‘s Recycle” and “Waste-Pro”. After the interview, the cases were analysed with respect to different factors such as motivational factors, entrepreneurial journey, support and challenges in managing social enterprise and the contribution towards environmental sustainability which in turn helps in achieving sustainable development goals. The findings of the study also discuss the level of social innovations adopted while designing, developing and using services/products for target groups. The findings of the study reveal that protecting the environment is paramount for the survival of mankind and therefore, only when the environment is looked after, can mankind survive. Thus, the study provides a theoretical and practical contribution to the role of social innovations implemented by social enterprises and offers useful reflections for policy makers and social innovation education. © IJSTR 2019.},

We consider how academic entrepreneurs can undertake commercial activities, and which ones, and how these activities contribute to the contexts of social innovation. We explore two cases that are derived from two premier universities in Taiwan in terms of research and academic entrepreneurship: OurCityLove from National Chiao Tung University (NCTU) and the Forest app from National Tsing Hua University (NTHU). The two cases show how social enterprises achieved the financial ability to expand their businesses and create the desired social values. While the first case, derived from NCTU, focused on providing useful information on social spaces, and services for the elderly, parents traveling with babies and those with disabilities (and also creating job opportunities for the latter), the other from NTHU created an app to influence those addicted to playing with their smartphones. The cases illustrate how the two universities capitalised on their technological competencies and academic programmes to support graduates and researchers in venturing into social entrepreneurship. © 2019 SAGE Publications.},

abstract={The base-of-the-pyramid (BoP) concept plays a prominent role among the market-based perspectives for poverty alleviation. Previous literature reviews discuss the evolution of the BoP concept as a research domain; however, several major research streams that approach the phenomenon from distinct angles have been overlooked. To address these shortcomings, we continue these reviews and formulate recommendations for theoretical and empirical advancement by considering emerging research domains. We use the problematization method to identify in-house and field assumptions shared across research domains and test them through critical empirical and theoretical interrogation. Therefore, we extend the original BoP concept by considering emerging research domains that have been neglected in earlier studies, including corporate social responsibility, inclusive business, microfinance, nonprofit expansion, social entrepreneurship, and subsistence marketplaces. We also revise the BoP business model idea and develop a framework that highlights key dimensions for management research in BoP markets. These dimensions include business ecosystems, financial viability, innovativeness, resource scarcity, role of the poor, and scalability. For each dimension, we develop future research questions.

abstract={Empirical evidence establishes that entrepreneurs pursue and achieve different goals and objectives with their ventures ranging from purely economic to purely social (e.g. non-profits) in nature. The reason that individual entrepreneurs choose to pursue such divergent paths is currently poorly understood, however. We employ a perspective integrating generational theory, goal-setting theory and the theory of planned behaviour to determine why entrepreneurs of different ages pursue social performance in their ventures. Using a sample of 150 entrepreneurs belonging to Baby Boomer, Generation X and Millennial generations, we examined the relationship between age, social salience and the social performance of their firms. Findings suggest a mediated relationship between age, social salience and social performance. © The Author(s) 2018.},

abstract={An effective scaling strategy can enable social entrepreneurs to significantly increase their organizations’ impact. Bloom and Chatterji’s SCALERS framework identifies seven capabilities social ventures can develop to effectively scale social impact: staffing, communicating, alliance-building, lobbying, earnings generation, replicating, and stimulating market forces. Empirical testing of SCALERS offers the potential to validate this framework, as well as to uncover additional capabilities necessary for scaling. In an examination of qualitative data from a case study of rapid social venture growth, our study tests the SCALERS framework. We find two additional capabilities important to effective scaling: internal systems (the formal processes and procedures used to run the organization, including information systems and planning systems) and client selection (choosing which clients to serve and, conversely, which not to serve). We also find that the extent to which communication constitutes a service of the venture is a contingency influencing the importance of communicating capabilities, and that clients’ ability to pay is a contingency impacting the importance of earnings generation capabilities. Keywords: social entrepreneurship; social impact; stakeholder theory Une stratégie de mise à l'échelle efficace peut permettre aux entrepreneurs sociaux d'accroître considérablement l'impact de leurs organisations. Le cadre SCALERS de Bloom et Chatterji identifie sept capacités que les entreprises sociales peuvent développer pour réduire efficacement l'impact social: dotation en personnel, communication, création d'alliances, lobbying, génération de revenus, réplication et stimulation des forces du marché. Les tests empiriques de SCALERS offrent la possibilité de valider ce cadre et de découvrir des fonctionnalités supplémentaires nécessaires à la mise à l'échelle. Dans un examen de données qualitatives issues d'une étude de cas sur la croissance rapide de l'activité sociale, notre étude teste le cadre SCALERS. Nous trouvons deux fonctionnalités supplémentaires importantes pour une mise à l'échelle efficace: les systèmes internes (les processus et procédures formels utilisés pour gérer l'organisation, y compris les systèmes d'information et les systèmes de planification) et la sélection des clients (choisir les clients à servir et inversement). Nous constatons également que la mesure dans laquelle la communication constitue un service de l'entreprise conditionne l'importance des capacités de communication et que la capacité de paiement des clients est un facteur de risque qui pèse sur l'importance des capacités de génération de bénéfices. © 2018, © 2018 Journal of the Canadian Council for Small Business and Entrepreneurship/Conseil de la PME et de l’entrepreneuriat.},

Design/methodology/approach: This paper is based on secondary data sources including legal documents, annual reports and websites of the social entrepreneurship-related organizations. Findings: This paper finds that social entrepreneurship in Russia is located between civil society, the State and the market and it is the State that became a main driving force behind social entrepreneurship development. Originality/value: This paper is the first to perceive the social entrepreneurship in modern Russia as a phenomenon with “semi-official” status. The original models and the very typology of social entrepreneurship are based on the newly introduced concept of “social-entrepreneurial mission”. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Contemporary scholarship recognises the growing importance of entrepreneurship globally, and increasingly acknowledges that entrepreneurship is a gendered phenomenon. As a consequence, research in the area of gender and entrepreneurship has attracted considerable attention from researchers, practitioners and policy makers in recent years, and its theoretical reach has extended beyond the traditional commercial/for-profit sector into social and non-profit ventures. In light of this, our chapter considers why adopting a gendered perspective in social entrepreneurship is both important and timely. We provide an overview of how gender is conceptualised in social entrepreneurship, consider key contemporary themes in the gender and social entrepreneurship literatures, and map out some new research directions for future scholars that could potentially add value to the field and enhance understanding of gender and social entrepreneurial endeavour. © Anne de Bruin and Simon Teasdale 2019.

abstract={This paper focuses on how the phenomenon of food tourism developed in Ireland between 2009 and 2019. Employing a phenomenological epistemology, a qualitative methodology was adopted to explore key stakeholder's lived experience of the Irish government's approach to food tourism, identifying the primary drivers and key moments during the ten-year period. Extant literature was reviewed and critically evaluated. Using purposive sampling, and employing an emic posture, ten semi-structured interviews were conducted with senior governmental and tourism industry figures until saturation occurred. The findings highlight the influence that key policy makers, the formation of networks, clusters, and the role social entrepreneurs had on developing food tourism in Ireland. The influence of the economic downturn in 2008 was a force for change and creativity among both government agencies and the broader tourism and hospitality industry. Food tourism policy was aligned with broader government policy, the creation of regional tourism brands (Wild Atlantic Way etc.), linking gastronomy with cultural and other tourism initiatives and marketing strategies. Whereas food in tourism in Ireland is well established, only ten per cent of overseas visitors are travelling specifically for food experiences. © 2019 Akdeniz University Publishing House.

abstract={Notwithstanding the growing interest in social entrepreneurship (SE) education, the SE field is gradually losing its “social” status. Accordingly, there is a need to emphasise the “social” aspect of SE education in order to clearly distinguish SE from the corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices implemented by mainstream entrepreneurs. This study argue that, in order to clearly differentiate between social value and CSR, SE education should help develop social entrepreneurs that are both responsible and socially innovative. This study explores teaching content and methods that can enhance the formation of potential social innovative thinking, responsible, social entrepreneurs by examining the syllabi of 5 UK business schools offering SE as a course or a module. The study also interviewed 8 SE instructors responsible for designing and delivering these SE courses/modules and 30 students who successfully passed through the SE courses/modules across these five business schools. Drawing on data analysed using comparative analysis methods and the social identity theory, this study presents a model that instructors can draw on and help students categorise and identify as potential social innovative thinking, responsible, social entrepreneurs. © 2019, Allied Business Academies.

abstract={This paper deliberates on the dimensions of entrepreneurship development with self-help groups (SHG) in India. It is an innovative form of entrepreneurship development and employment generation. Entrepreneurship plays a vital role in the growth and development of any country and society. The self-help groups involved in businesses in India are majorly run by women. It provides economic development, empowerment, and social equality to the members. A self-help group is a small informal voluntary association of people mainly from the same socioeconomic strata. It enables them to become self-dependent, self-sufficient, and self-reliant. The self-help groups are more creative and innovative, as they are more flexible and informal. They come together to solve their common problems through group entrepreneurship. Unemployment is rising, and it has a more significant impact on women than men in India, but entrepreneurship by self-help groups is creating marginal improvements in employment and income of women in India. The study was piloted using a questionnaire on a sample of 240 members of self-help groups in India. The factor analysis was employed to realise the gains, and the outcome of the study specifies the functioning, innovation, and challenges of self-help group entrepreneurship. It also examines the demographics, distribution, and contribution of self-help groups for entrepreneurship. © 2019, Research Trend. All rights reserved.},

The study combined two related constructs: social innovation and the administration of refugees in a camp environment. Existing research has studied social innovation. However, there is limited research on social innovation in the context of refugees. This study offers a comprehensive approach by defining social innovation contextually and determines if certain knowledge can be classified as social innovation. The results would indicate that social innovation projects do exist within the human resource development, political influence, social and entrepreneurial frameworks. Hence, in contributing to the theory on social innovation, further work should focus on the context in which the social innovation is studied, as the context could affect the outcome. The findings will be of value to future investments in both social innovation and social entrepreneurship, in particular within socially deprived environments. © 2019, Sciedu Press.

The ranking analysis of the survey results shows that 28 factors are rated as critical for determining the S-ENT success of a social enterprise. Further, the factor analysis revealed that the identified CSFs can be grouped into seven clusters, namely leadership, social enterprise planning, community engagement, innovative financing, human capital, legal support, and social enterprise marketing. The outcome of the thesis provides pioneering insights through a structured framework for investigating the individual CSFs and their different levels of contribution to S-ENT success. The inventive knowledge generated out of the thesis work, can be specifically fruitful for practitioners and other stakeholders in identifying the areas of their social enterprise functioning that demand their utmost priority and attention, in identifying the skills and resources required for their venture success, in assessing their competitive advantage and in helping to setup evaluation mechanism of their ventures etc. The pioneering insights can also be utilised by academicians for theory building and further analysis in the field.

Arising from requirements for regulatory compliance, some global north industries have ventured into CE, and now this model is making headway in all industrial sectors, whereas, in the global south, CE has been conceptualised as a mechanism for keeping materials out of the waste streams otherwise destined to reach landfills, waterways etc. CE indicates pathways for industries and civic society to transit to a more sustainable economy, to reduce or eliminate waste through development of new business models, eco-designs, and sustainable consumption and production strategies. Presented herein are the lessons learned from the CE-based waste-to-wealth projects in Sri Lanka with an emphasis on the cultural, economic, and structural roadblocks faced by the micro-social entrepreneurs in this field.

abstract={Purpose: Social entrepreneurs innovatively exploit opportunities and create, in this way, social change and value by bringing together different resources to meet social needs and solve social problems. To achieve this, given their limited size and financial resources, the personal ties and social networks that social entrepreneurs build in this process play a crucial role in developing relationships and enabling their ventures to succeed. The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of network processes in innovative activities carried out by social entrepreneurs and to stress the importance of network processes rather than network structure/design for social innovation. Design/methodology/approach: “Çöp(m)adam” (Garbage Ladies), a social development project and business in Ayvalik, Turkey (which aims to provide opportunities for women who have never had the chance to work and earn regular salaries in the course of their lifetimes), was explored qualitatively as a case study within the framework of the network orchestration theory. In-depth, semi-structured interviews and observations were conducted. Relevant documents about Çöp(m)adam were also collected at the time of the interview to provide the triangulation of reference material for thematic analysis and post-research inquiry. Findings: It has been found that Çöp(m)adam dynamically manages the network process in the course of realizing social innovation and builds a win-win environment that creates value both for the future of the social enterprise and for all the actors in the network by integrating the relationships among the actors it is in a relationship with. Originality/value: In contrast to traditional studies dealing with the network theory, this research focuses on network processes rather than network structure. Also, since the literature provides evidence for profit-based organizations, the study differentiates into two main reasons. First, the authors adopt a case study approach in social entrepreneurship for social value creation, and second, based on the case study, the authors provide a conceptual enrichment through proposing the sub-categories of knowledge mobility, innovation appropriability and network stability in orchestration processes. This paper seeks to broaden the existing understanding of how social entrepreneurial processes and innovative outcomes are shaped by social networks and orchestration processes in a network-centric innovation from the viewpoint of a hub/focal firm by undertaking research on a less examined type of enterprise and context – namely, a social entrepreneurial venture in Turkey. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: CoNSENSo is a project funded by the European Union, which is aimed at developing an innovative care model based on community nurses to support active ageing in mountain areas. The planned sustainability of this innovative approach relies on social entrepreneurship on the healthcare market, and this work highlights the necessary conditions for the successful implementation of these entrepreneurial initiatives. METHODS: Considering municipalities in the Piedmont Region and those aged 65 or older as target population, the authors propose several negative binomial regression models to estimate the effectiveness of current private healthcare services in supporting the active aging process. Such effectiveness may represent the ex-ante (positive) reputation of these new social entrepreneurial initiatives on the market. RESULTS: According to our results, the private supply of healthcare services can effectively support the aging process. Indeed, given that the other predictor variables in the model are held constant, there are statistically significant negative relations between the number of hip fractures and the private supply of healthcare services by dental practitioners and psychologists (p-value < 0.05), as well as the private supply of opportunities for social interaction by coffee bars (p-value < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The authors expect a favourable environment for the entrepreneurial initiatives of community nurses in mountain areas. Accordingly, policy makers cannot reject the hypothesis that the goals reached by the CoNSENSo project may be maintained for the sake of the future generations, avoiding its collapse as soon as public funding shifts to new programmes.},

abstract={: Social entrepreneurship (SE) refers to the development of innovative projects whose main aim is not individual profit but the transformation of society. The issue is particularly important for promoting youth development and participation. This research offers insights from two studies designed from a multi-dimensional perspective analysing attitudes and behavioural intentions towards social ventures built upon the constructs of servant leadership and lifestyles. Results of Study 1 indicated that servant leadership is a key predictor of attitudes and behavioural intentions towards social entrepreneurship, while having a violent lifestyle is negatively associated with these attitudes and intentions. Study 2 showed that servant leadership style predicted attitudes towards social entrepreneurship over and above other types of leadership (i.e., transformational, transactional and laissez-faire). These studies demonstrate the importance of considering servant leadership and relational styles as key factors in predicting attitudes and behavioural intentions regarding social and active participation of young people. Limitations of the study and applications to designing interventions aimed at improving attitudes and behavioural intentions towards social entrepreneurship are discussed. © 2018, © 2018 Fundacion Infancia y Aprendizaje.},

abstract={The aim of this article is to discuss ethical dilemmas that occur in doing research on social entrepreneurial sport ventures. Three cases that highlight ethical dilemmas in research on social entrepreneurship and sport are presented and ethically reflected upon. The data comprise interviews with representatives, field notes from observations and analyses of documents concerning the ventures. Three things make research in this area extra problematic: first, ‘social good’ in social entrepreneurship and sport implies a normative perspective. It is permeated by ideology and ethics. Second, what is considered as ‘social good’ may differ between sectors of society as the entrepreneur crosses boundaries. What is valid as a resource and capital in one sector might not be so in another one, and what is legal within one sector may be illegal in another. Third, social entrepreneurs may have their own intentions with regard to participating in research, which may challenge our credibility as researchers. Therefore, we need, as professionals, to take a step back and be both critical of our work and make this criticism visible, which is to some extent what we are doing by writing this article. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

abstract={Purpose: This paper examines the case of Nashoba, a Tennessee-based social enterprise founded in 1824 by Scottish immigrant Frances Wright. The Nashoba venture intended to diminish the institution of slavery in the USA through entrepreneurial activity over its five years of operation. Design/methodology/approach: This study methodology entailed mining primary source data from Wright’s letters; communications with her cofounders and contemporaries; and documentations of enterprise operations. The authors examined these data using social enterprise theory with a focus on personal identity and time-laden empirical aspects not captured by traditional methodologies. Findings: The social enterprise concept of a single, self-sustaining model generating more than one denomination of value in a blended form has a deeper history than the literature acknowledges. As an entrepreneur, Wright made strategic decisions in a context of supply-side and demand-side threats to the venture. The social enterprise engaged injustice by going beyond market and state contexts to generate impact in the realms of institutions and non-excludable public goods. Research limitations/implications: This study generates two formal implications for the development of new research questions in social enterprise studies. The first implication addresses the relation between social entrepreneurs and their constituencies. The second implication pertains to the effects of macro-level education, awareness and politics on social enterprise performance and impact. The implications herald new insights in social enterprise, such as the limits of moral conviction and the importance of social disruption. Originality/value: This paper broadens the current understanding of how social enterprises redress unjust and unethical institutions. It also contributes new insights into social enterprise launch and growth based on shared values within communities and coordinated strategic intentions across communities. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={This paper presents the development of the enterprise sector and the welfare regime in Poland, dominated by two opposing trends originating from the country’s recent history: remnants of the “Communist welfare state” and liberal tendencies that came after the political and economic transformation in 1989. The growing civil society that supplements a deficient welfare system finds its roots in the peaceful underground Solidarity movement of the 1980s which played a great role in liberating Poland. After the political turnover, the Solidarity’s mission-driven approach not only survived, but also helped shape Poland’s contemporary civil society. The outlined mechanisms seem to be significant for understanding the transformation of social economy and the welfare state concept in post-communist Europe. In our paper, we identify six mechanisms underlying the Solidarity movement, which, when subsequently implemented by social entrepreneurs, has guaranteed the success of their organizations. We will also characterize the current welfare state in Poland, as well as the role of social enterprises in filling the gaps and addressing the shortcomings of the welfare state. Several case studies will illustrate the latter. © 2017, International Society for Third-Sector Research and The Johns Hopkins University.},

These were introduced to address lack of laws to form - charitable social enterprises.

The objective of this paper is to explore the possibility of introducing a new legal framework for social entrepreneurs in Malaysia. This legal framework could be used to carry out business activities and gain profit with a clear purpose that profits of the business shall be used for public interest.

Those most active have often crossed business, creative, and philanthropic sectors in ways we describe as “social entrepreneurial.” The Asheville downtown coalition differs from the progrowth as well as the populist (progressive) regimes identified in other literature, but offers insights into downtown development efforts as urban governance becomes more fragmented and city development policy more focused on tourism and consumption. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.},

Though Algeria has invested heavily in large-scale government-sponsored employment programs, unemployment, especially among the youth, remains stubbornly high, leading to a number of serious social and security problems (criminality, drug usage, suicides, illegal emigration, terrorism, etc.). We argue that social entrepreneurship combined with franchising has the potential to foster quickly a large number of social entrepreneurs, leading to the creation of a large number of sustainable jobs, especially among the educated youth in Algeria and, by extension, in many emerging countries. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract={This chapter explores the recent decades’ rapid spreading of a discourse which says that business and profitability can be combined with ethical conduct and social concerns. The idea of combining business with “doing good” can be theorised as a new “spirit” of capitalism: the spirit of a “civic” capitalism where corporations are discursively constructed as socially responsible (virtuous) citizens in society. The idea that corporations can “do well” by “doing good” challenges the traditional economic rationality of business, most famously summarized by Milton Friedman who declared that “the business of business is business.” But by arguing that there is a business case for “doing good,” the proponents of “civic capitalism” offer a new economic rationale in two ways, related to two dimensions of economic rationality. First, they argue for the direct economic rationale behind social activities (that they pay). This is why Milton Friedman would find less to worry about if he could revisit the debates today. Second, by making a dedifferentiation between a business and a social rationale, “civic capitalism” embodies a new economic rationality in the sense that it offers a social legitimacy of business. Critics of this spirit of civic capitalism draw on at least three types of criticism: a reality check, asking whether corporations actually practice what they preach; an ethical check, asking about which kinds of ethics is typically assumed in e.g. mainstream CSR or corporate philanthropy; and a democratic check, investigating the spread of e.g. CSR in the context of overall distribution of responsibilities between business, state, government and civil society. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract={The aim of this final chapter is to present a more detailed picture of several characteristics of codesign for the public-interest. In describing the infrastructuring process in ten steps, we have already stressed the importance of codesign as way to enhance public imagination, especially in a hybrid area between public and private, profit and not-for-profit, amateur and professional, market and society. This is the area of public-interest, in which a configuration of diverse actors (coming from citizen activism, and the public, private and third sectors) undertake an unprecedented collaboration to reach a common purpose, i.e. to design services together. In this chapter, we analyse the codesign process for the public interest, not only as it relates to the creation of new services, but also in connection with the codesign of other ‘items’ in a multi-level perspective (including services, policies and innovation processes etc.). Therefore, we will present several features that highlight the complexity and possible extension of the value of the codesign process, ranging from considering it as a form of citizen empowerment, to regarding it as an important pre-condition to service co-production, or as a key-competence for the public sector. The chapter (and thus the whole book) concludes by focusing its attention on the prominent position that codesign processes (especially when devoted to supporting the public interest) are reaching in the current, more general, discussion on design and innovation. The popular design thinking approach is de facto a codesign approach; many (social) innovation processes are de facto codesign processes (for the public interest): • Codesign as a form of citizen empowerment; • Codesign as a collective and active reflection; • Codesign as a precondition to co-production; • Codesign as a public service (and key competence for the public sector); • Codesign as a form of citizen participation and democracy; • Codesign process as (social) innovation process. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.},

abstract={Social Entrepreneurship has become a buzzword due to the exponentially rising number of scientific works devoted to this topic. The prevalent part of the research focuses on the social side of the venture, while the other equally important entrepreneurial side is still in the shadows. Can it be that social entrepreneurs do not value the entrepreneurial aspect (inventing, founding and developing) of social entrepreneurship and are engaged in these activities merely because of other goals and passions (for example "helping", "social welfare" etc.)? This research conducted in Entrepreneurial passion, aims to identify the differences within the domain of inventing, founding and developing passion among social and commercial entrepreneurs. The paper also aims to find out if the cliché about the social cause being the only force that moves social entrepreneurs is right. The primary data was collected among 87 social and 119 commercial entrepreneurs. The Welch's t-test and the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test were applied. As a result, no statistically significant differences were found in any of the mentioned aspects (Inventing, founding and developing) of entrepreneurial passion of social and commercial entrepreneurs. © 2017 Central European Business Review.},

abstract={This chapter discusses the concept of ideological latency specifically the degree to which the Fordist mind-set persists as an interpretative and problem-solving device in so-called post-industrial societies. It explores the experiences of Detroit’s urban farmers and small-time entrepreneurs in their efforts to revitalise a severely decayed inner-city economy. The chapter suggests that while Detroit’s social entrepreneurs embrace such post-Fordist concepts as diversification, flexibility, individuation, improvisation and responsiveness. The city’s politicians, bureaucrats, business people and industrialists adhere to Fordist concepts like rationalisation, scale, massification, hierarchical management structures, the privileging of expert over other, more grounded forms of knowledge, top-down planning and scientific and technological innovation. It is concluded that the Fordist mind-set or idiom lingers on. The spontaneous planting of vacant land by unemployed residents and incomers represents the purest articulation of the late-modern blueprint. The Risk Society thesis plays out in citizens’ awareness of their plight and direct experience of disamenity and threat. © Simon Bennett 2012.},

Findings indicate that green businesses and social entrepreneurs have uniquely engaged in social training and hiring strategies related to green jobs. The major challenges they face include a lack of policies that support the development of green jobs through social training and hiring. As a result of these findings, an argument is made for combining job and life skills for both disadvantaged populations and the agencies that serve them as well as building the capacity of employers to practise social hiring. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to clarify the multiple different approaches of social innovation, focusing on francophone literature. Originality/gap/relevance/implications: We propose an in-depth literature review that questions the meaning of the adjective “social” when used by authors to qualify an innovation, that highlights the different approaches of the concept, their relations to each other and their limits, and that illustrates these approaches with concrete examples. Finally, we build on these materials to propose a new innovation typology that wholly integrates social innovation. Key methodological aspects: The literature review is based on a selection of 25 papers in French - the mother language of the author - which were collected and analyzed using the “theoretical saturation point” method: we stopped the review when we felt there was no new crucial element in the next articles read, that is, when it seemed that a “saturation point” of information had been reached about theories on social innovation. Summary of key results: The definition of social innovation as new answers provided to unsatisfied or badly-satisfied social demands seems to prevail in the literature. It can be divided into three sub-approaches: the public policies, the social entrepreneurship, and the participatory dynamics, which strikes us as the most interesting, without excluding the others. Key considerations/conclusions: We propose a new innovation typology, which presents social innovation's relations to other types of innovation. We conclude with some considerations about social innovation context of emergence, and about its ambiguous position in the neoliberal system. © 2016 Mackenzie Presbyterian University.

abstract={There is currently a major debate on the role of universities as producers of knowledge for development in their societies. The central issue is that universities are increasingly moving towards more commercially oriented knowledge production rather than social-a condition producing inequalities and environmentally undesirable effects. And therefore a need to reorient universities towards production of knowledge that is more socially useful is called for. However, while most of the knowledge produced by universities in developed countries is driven by markets, those by universities in poor countries-because of their poverty-seems to be driven by public actors such as donors and governments, and therefore we would expect knowledge production to be more socially oriented. This chapter endeavored to validate this point by looking at innovation-related programs at two universities in Tanzania. The analysis shows that most of the innovation programs offered by these universities are more inclined towards social orientation than commercial. Consequently, the question is raised whether it makes sense to focus the debate on social innovation for poor countries in the absence of effective systems for commercial innovations that has brought about most of the human progress in developed countries. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.},

abstract={This study defines and proposes a measurement scale for social entrepreneurship (SE) in its broadest sense. The broad definition of SE covers for-profit firms that use social aims as a core component of their strategy. By pursuing social aims, these firms can boost the value of their products or services for consumers or exploit new business areas. Under this broad definition of SE, profit-seeking and the pursuit of social aims converge, thereby revealing a form of SE that has received little attention in either theoretical or empirical research. To fill this research gap, the present study proposes a measurement scale to measure broad SE in firms. The process used to build the scale draws upon research by Churchill (1979) and DeVellis (1991) and combines the Delphi technique, a pre-test questionnaire and structural equation modelling. The main aim of this research is to develop a scale capable of measuring broad SE in firms. The theoretical basis for the scale is supported by an empirical study in the hotel sector. The scale provides a valid, reliable instrument for measuring broad SE in firms. The scale meets all sociometric properties required of measurement scales in the social sciences, namely dimensionality, reliability and validity.},

abstract={In Romania, responsible corporate behavior was initially evaluated based on commercial considerations of image and reputation, and not in terms of sustainable development or stakeholders needs. However, recently there has been a shift towards the implementation of the second approach, responsible practices being associated with long-term success, directly proportional to community development, environmental welfare and practices and connections within the area of influence. Despite the significant progress on the integration of responsible practices in organizations core business since EU accession, a number of challenges continue to exist, which must be addressed by all stakeholders, including increasing awareness of CSR/SR significance and of the integrated approach involved by the implementation of responsible practices; increasing awareness of the needs and benefits associated with incorporating responsible practices into business objectives and operations to ensure sustainable success; and increasing transparency, monitoring and assessment of CSR initiatives impact on all involved or affected stakeholders. Lately, there have been identified action areas considered fundamental to define tools that enhance social responsibility like Corporate social responsibility in the area of human resources; Social entrepreneurship; Fostering social responsibility through public procurement system; Corporate social responsibility in SMEs; CSR Reporting; Responsible Consumption; Social responsibility in schools and universities.

abstract={Over recent years the value of start-ups has been changing rapidly. This paper presents a methodological and quantitative model of the emergent valued practices. Using the SABI data in 2012 it is shown the social value of start-up and consolidate companies; at least in two of its aspects: generation of economic value with social impact and socio-economic return. The application of this model makes possible the quantitative and monetized comparison of integrated value between companies, which would involve more efficient decision-making. Quantitative analysis revealed that this model makes possible the comparison between start-up and consolidated companies. The results indicate that there are differences between them and the created value of start-up companies is bigger than that created by consolidated ones; at least in relation to suppliers, administration and shareholders. It reinforces the importance of the start-up companies in our society from the value point of view and reflects the need by authorities to improve the quality and process of value quantification using the social frameworks. Moreover this model could be used as a tool to value the benchmarking process of the social entrepreneurship. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={Active learning can serve as a platform for addressing sustainability, ethics, and social entrepreneurship by engaging students in experiential activities with external organisations for initiatives with a social mission. A variety of active learning approaches provide an opportunity to promote collaboration between students and external organisations in pursuit of a socially beneficial goal. This paper highlights different active learning approaches that emphasise sustainability, ethics, and social entrepreneurship in undergraduate and graduate management education. These approaches include experiential learning methods, such as undergraduate case competitions and global MBA case studies, as well as action learning methods, such as live consulting projects and cross-national student collaborations. These active learning approaches can help students address ethical, social, and environmental issues in complex business situations. Copyright © 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

The study exhibits that “inquisitive” is the state of innovativeness of prospective teachers that male prospective teachers are primarily leaders, and that female prospective teachers are primarily inquisitive according to their personal innovativeness states. The findings also demonstrate that the social entrepreneurship features of innovative prospective teachers are higher, and that there is a positive and statistically significant relationship between social entrepreneurship features and the personal innovativeness of prospective teachers. Further, the social entrepreneurship characteristics of prospective teachers can be reinforced by some projects increasing their personal innovativeness. © Kamla-Raj 2014.},

More and more citizens are using entrepreneurial skills in building sustainable enterprises, profit and non-profit to bring change in country and to address global societal, ethical or environmental value issues primarily at local level. But it is imperative to scale up the operations and maintain acceptable quality standards through the perspective of productions and operations management. This study provides a comparative analysis of eight cases of social entrepreneurship in the field of healthcare and education sectors in India and suggests factors associated with scaling up of operations that leads to significant changes at the base of pyramid to marginalised and poor people and are able to overcome the hurdles to socio-economic and sustainable development in poor countries.

abstract={The central assumption of publicly-supported market development programs is that providing resources to local entrepreneurs and strengthening the business environments fosters the emergence of self-sustaining local energy access ventures. We explore this assumption by applying a business model lens to analyze how participation in a market development program affects the development of local energy access ventures. Using the domestic biogas market development program in Rwanda as our case, we evaluate program design, the role of local entrepreneurs and interactions between participating ventures and the coordinating office to determine how market development programs contribute to a self-sustaining private energy sector. While providing a detailed framework for local ventures, the business model offers entrepreneurs few possibilities to act entrepreneurial and exploit local opportunities. Consequently, such programs will attract necessity-driven rather than opportunity-and growth-driven entrepreneurs, causing concern for the achievement of program objectives and the establishment of a self-sustaining private sector. © 2014 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

Grand challenges such as energy scarcity and resource depletion will have substantial impacts on the functioning of contemporary business models. Companies, however, still largely focus on efficiency strategies leading to sub-optimal solutions rather than radically changing their business model. Design/methodology/approach: – It describes a project that has been run for a social enterprise in which a transition management approach was used to discover their new future role and explore new business concepts that function within the boundaries of significantly different material management principles. Findings: – The authors discuss how this case study can contribute to the limited developed empirical research on how businesses can be more proactive in changing the way societal systems operate, and whether the approach can be relevant for transfer to the wider business community. Practical implications: – It offers a practical approach for businesses to innovate their business model while taking into regard sustainability issues. Originality/value: – The paper combines the transition management framework with business model innovation. © 2014, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={‘From partnership to ownership and beyond’ was one of the inspiring foci of the UN Development Programme (UNDP) report ‘Capacity Development: new solutions to old problems’ (UNDP, 2002, p. 14) which emphasised that capacity development, transferring ownership to the poor, finding new solutions and creating new opportunities represent the way forward in the development of marginalised groups. Since the publication of this report in 2002, this emphasis on self-reliance has received increasing support with, for example, Moyo (2010) strongly advocating entrepreneurship as a way in which people can get out of their position of dependency. Many others argue that entrepreneurship could be an answer for the many problems in developing countries (Gries and Naudé, 2009). Entrepreneurship has been described as an engine of economic growth (Austin et al., 2006), and the most successful approach to overcoming poverty at the grassroots level (Dixon and Clifford, 2007; Kolawole and Torimiro, 2005). There are ‘a growing number of initiatives all over the globe [that] seem to be defying the obstacles that have prevented businesses from providing services to the poor’ (Seelos and Mair, 2005a, p. 242). These initiatives have collectively been dubbed ‘social entrepreneurship’. Social entrepreneurs connect social and economic aims sustainably in their activities (Basu, 2012; Zahra et al., 2009) and social entrepreneurship is considered to be especially relevant in developing countries with their intertwined socio-economic and environmental challenges (Babu and Pinstrup-Andersen, 2007). © Phillip H.

Many companies take these developments very seriously, as they understand that they are part of a new way of doing business in the future and thus create their own capacity to endure. One of the key challenges is, however, a partially unclear understanding of the concepts, how they can be implemented and how an impact can be created. In addition, concepts like Social Entrepreneurship or Sustainable Innovation exist and add to the complexity. As with most new concepts, this unclear understanding could ultimately hinder the development of a concept that, if applied seriously, might have a significant contribution on improving the way we collaborate, innovate and ultimately have a positive impact on the world. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Purpose - In this chapter, I develop a theoretical framework to address the financial-social performance debate in strategy research, drawing on literatures on institutional logics and organizational forms. Methodology/design - I test the theoretical framework using an exploratory empirical approach based on ideal types with global microfinance data. A joint consideration of financial and social performances of microfinance organizations (MFOs) helps classify them into four ideal types - self-sustainable, mission-drifting, failing, and subsidized. I examine how an MFO's organizational form and the configurations of institutional logics of the nation within which it is embedded jointly explain which ideal type the MFO falls into. Findings - Based on a study of 1455 MFOs in 98 countries between 1995 and 2007, I show that the interactions between national institutional logics and organizational forms add significant predicting power in estimating MFOs' ideal types. Explaining the intricate relationships between the financial and social performance of MFOs thus requires a simultaneous consideration of both the configuration of national logics and organizational forms. Originality/value - The theoretical framework introduced in this chapter builds on recent developments in the institutional logics perspective and research on organizational forms, extending our understanding of the financial-social performance relationship among organizations. It also advances the social entrepreneurship literature by focusing our attention on various institutions at both national and organizational levels that may facilitate or inhibit social venture efficacy. © 2014 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.},

The study investigates the prevalence of early stage social entrepreneurship activity amongst the Norwegian adult population. As much as 5.1% of the population is at any time engaged in nascent social entrepreneurship, as measured in involvement in the starting up non-profit volunteer organisations. Males, younger and better educated people are more inclined to engage in nascent social entrepreneurship. Institutional factors such as social needs and municipality centrality are linked to start-up of social entrepreneurial activity. Different structural frameworks link to different categories of social entrepreneurship. Social bricoleur activity aimed at creating social value more often appears in rural municipalities. Social constructionists and social engineers wanting societal change are negatively correlated with social requirements in their home municipality. This paper discusses how better to categorise nascent social entrepreneurship activity in order to improve our understanding of its drivers. © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={Responding to local, regional and international demands and initiatives, the government of Ecuador has rolled out an innovative program Sistema Integral de Tecnologías para la Escuela y la Comunidad (SíTEC) to place information, and communication technologies (ICTs) into the hands of students, teachers, and other educational institutions. SíTEC draws upon several elements of social entrepreneurship and has successfully reached some of the most regionally remote and culturally diverse communities in the country. The SíTEC program is emblematic of many of the criteria set forth regarding social entrepreneurship including the vision of leadership, the focus on a social mission and the importance of innovation in partnership and resource allocation. This study looks at survey and interview data from the Shiña community teachers and school leaders to determine the effects of the SíTEC program and the availability and use of ICTs in schools, SíTEC has equipped public schools with computers, projectors, digital boards, and Internet. Additionally, SíTEC organizes training courses on ICTs for public school teachers and provides schools with educational software available in Spanish, Kichwa, Shuar, and English. While there is still much work to be done, SíTEC and the associated partnerships and programs are beginning to have impact in their specified outcomes. Creative partnerships developed within the Ministry of Education, Office of Bilingual Education, Shiña community have allowed for communication and exchange of knowledge and resources across multiple partners.

The influence that the global shift from natural resource and industry-based economies to knowledge-based economies has had on the development of educational innovation and entrepreneurship is explained. Several examples of educational innovation and education-oriented public sector entrepreneurship highlight the discussion, which concludes with an examination of specific knowledge society issues related to educational entrepreneurship and its reciprocal effect on innovation.

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the usefulness of the social entrepreneurship (SE) framework in highlighting effective models of service development and practice in mental health equity. Design/methodology/approach: Using a rigorous SE search process and a multiple case study design, core themes underlying the effectiveness of five services in Toronto, Canada for transgender, Aboriginal, immigrant, refugee, and homeless populations were determined. Findings: It was found that the SE construct is highly applicable in the context of services addressing mental health inequities. In the analysis five core themes emerged that characterized the development of these organizations: the personal investment of leaders within a social justice framework; a very active period of clarifying values and mission, engaging partners, and establishing structure; applying a highly innovative approach; maintaining focus, keeping current, and exceeding expectations; and acting more as a service working from within a community than a service for a community. Practical implications: These findings may have utility as a guide for individuals early in their trajectories of SE in the area of mental health equity and as a tool that can be used by decision maker "champions" to better identify and support SE endeavours. Originality/value: In a context characterized by increasing attention given to models of SE in health equity, this study is the first to directly examine applicability to mental health equity. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

The paper explores the profile of Romanian social entrepreneurs with a particular attention paid to social economy area. The research hypothesis is that the empowerment of vulnerable people towards social economy through entrepreneurship is rather an exception than a general sustainable employment solution. The second research hypothesis is that the employment of vulnerable people in social economy area is supported by social insertion enterprises rather than social enterprises. The first part of the paper is focused on international and national regulations as well as institutional framework with an impact on social economy and vulnerable groups. The second part of the paper explores the profile of Romanian entrepreneurs from an international comparative perspective. The third part of the paper assesses outputs of the European Social Fund (ESF) financed projects towards employment of vulnerable people. As methodology, the article is based on desk research on international and national regulations, primary and secondary analysis of EUROSTAT 2000-2012 Eurobarometer databases, and the database of Romanian volumes dedicated to social economy research. Our forecast is that successful implementation of ESF financed projects, especially priority axis 6 "Promoting social inclusion", main domain of intervention 6.1. Development of social economy depends on the ex-ante assessment of employability of vulnerable groups both as entrepreneurs and employees in social enterprises.},

abstract={The purpose of this paper is to analyse how the concept of district management has been developed in Japan and to identify its characteristics and issues, after illustrating the change in economic circumstances and policies regarding city centres since the 1940s. In Japan, the government has dealt with urban decay, first by large-scale commercial facility regulation, then by nurturing district management organisations responsible for developing and implementing revitalisation plans. A problem is that many of these organisations have depended on subsidy, thus it has been difficult to realise prolonged implementation. Under these circumstances, private district management organisations began to form, supported by the membership of property and business owners. Some of them soon developed independent businesses using local resources such as facility management, vacant buildings or public spaces in order to generate financial resources for district management. Although the largest challenge still exists-the issue of securing equal and stable funding based on compulsory tax or assessment, as in Business Improvement Districts-district management projects focusing on independent businesses using local resources are considered a realistic and non-responsibility-postponing approach with the aim of creating business plans with a good balance of income and expense. © Henry Stewart Publications.},

This results in reduction in employment and increase in unemployment. Public sector of economy should proceed to public investments and enhance development. However, in the present economic crisis, public sector does not develop initiatives, due to budget deficit; to the contrary public sector is confined and contributes to the maintenance of recession. Social sector of economy does not aim at profit making but at job creation, mainly for the vulnerable groups of population. It intervenes by taking actions of mild economic growth and contributes to economic recovery. For this reason, national legislations in Europe provide the establishment of social economy enterprises. Local government, which, in a sense, belongs to the social sector of economy, has the possibilities to reinforce both social economy enterprises and actions of social entrepreneurship aiming for the enhancement of local economy.},

abstract={Free, subsidized, or cost-covering? The decision on how much to charge for a good or service is fundamental in social business planning. The higher the fee paid by the recipient, the more people in need can be served by the additional revenues. However, charging a fee simultaneously excludes the very poor from consumption. This paper argues that the entrepreneur's trade-off between both effects is governed by her level of poverty aversion, i. e., her preference intensity for the service of needy people with different incomes. Additionally, we account for the possibility of excess demand for the provided good and assume that applicants are rationed by non-price-allocation mechanisms. We therefore contribute to the extensive literature on the pricing and rationing behavior of nonprofit firms. Within our theoretical model, we find ambiguous reactions of the entrepreneur to a cut in donations. Given a sufficiently low level of status-quo donations, entrepreneurs with relatively high poverty aversion tend to increase the project volume, whereas those with relatively low poverty aversion do the opposite. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={The purpose of this paper is to more closely examine the relationship between traditional cultural practices and the commercial products that are derived from and inspired by them. Existing institutional approaches to the cultural industries have been limited in their scope and empirical focus. This paper seeks to correct those oversights. The paper utilizes a focused historical case study of traditional Irish music, drawing from the myriad resources on the subject housed in the Boston College Irish Music Collection. A unique and parallel production system in traditional Irish music was identified – a symbiotic and mutually reinforcing relationship between traditional social practices and derivative commercial products that has not yet been articulated within institutional approaches to the cultural industries. By applying DiMaggio and Powell's totality of relevant actors criterion in organizational fields the authors identify and describe the significant contributions of a class of social actors, who have been been marginalized in research on cultural industries. The research has implications for practitioners in cultural industries – whether social entrepreneurs who wish to preserve or propagate traditional social practices or commercial entrepreneurs who wish to profit from them. The paper describes a symbiotic and sustainable relationship between these two classes of social actors and models a type of social entrepreneurship that can potentially be applied in other contexts. Both empirically and conceptually, the paper offers fresh insights into cultural industries and institutional theory. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

Social economy is considered one of the most important innovative strategy approaches as this sector may contribute to some efforts done for the elimination of poverty and the re-launching of local economies. The integration of the identified elements in regional programs and public policies is the starting point of the strategic approaches regarding reform in public administration.

abstract={The idea of " social entrepreneurship" has struck a responsive chord. It is a phrase well suited to our times. It combines the passion of a social mission with an image of business-like discipline, innovation, and determination commonly associated with, for instance, the high-tech pioneers of Silicon Valley. The time is certainly ripe for entrepreneurial approaches to social problems. Many governmental and philanthropic efforts have fallen far short of our expectations. Major social sector institutions are often viewed as inefficient, ineffective, and unresponsive. Social entrepreneurs are needed to develop new models for a new century.The language of social entrepreneurship may be new, but the phenomenon is not. We have always had social entrepreneurs, even if we did not call them that. They originally built many of the institutions we now take for granted. However, the new name is important in that it implies a blurring of sector boundaries. In addition to innovative not-for-profit ventures, social entrepreneurship can include social purpose business ventures, such as for-profit community development banks, and hybrid organizations mixing not-for-profit and for-profit elements, such as homeless shelters that start businesses to train and employ their residents. The new language helps to broaden the playing field. Social entrepreneurs look for the most effective methods of serving their social missions. Though the concept of " social entrepreneurship" is gaining popularity, it means different things to different people. This can be confusing. Many associate social entrepreneurship exclusively with not-forprofit organizations starting for-profit or earned-income ventures. Others use it to describe anyone who starts a not-for-profit organization. Social entrepreneurship, as described here, is not a tidy concept. Its untidiness has been argued here to be a reflection of the way that the world is. There are, however, significant landmarks in the complex geography of the concept, and the purpose of this paper has been to advance an understanding of those marks and their importance. The authors submit that the notion as outlined above makes a significant contribution to understanding the complex phenomenon of directing organizational activity toward the achievement of social purposes.},

abstract={Classical modernization and political economy approaches both consider a wide array of economic agents as potential drivers for change. These actors include international agents such as foreign companies (not only trans national corporations but also smaller companies), international orga - nizations, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and local agents such as national public companies, entrepreneurs, bureaucrats, and segments of civil societies involved in economic or social activities (professional associations, trade unions, and local NGOs). Several authors have highlighted the linkages between entrepreneurs and Mediterranean political systems, but their analyses have tended to focus on the role of large entrepreneurs.1 In fact, nobody could have anticipated that the self-immolation of a humiliated and frustrated street fruit vendor, Mohamed Bouazizi-who exemplified the overtrained, informal microentrepreneur-would catalyze the most profound upheaval seen in the Arab world since its independence. This chapter tries to fill this gap in the literature by analyzing entrepreneurship as a driver for social transformation, focusing on the role of small and medium enterprises (SMEs). While mainly dealing with the southern Mediterranean region, this discussion also includes some contextual references to the wider Middle East. The first section briefly presents the current situation of SMEs and entrepreneurship in North Africa. In the second section, we try to conceptually address the role of entrepreneurship as a driver for social change in North African countries. This is followed by an exploration of how SMEs and entrepreneurship are linked with other factors for change covered in this volume. The final section concludes with some implications and suggestions for U.S. and EU relationships with the region, as well as for transatlantic relations. Copyright © 2012 The Brookings Institution.},

abstract={We are currently experiencing a revolution in the world of social impact with the rise of social enterprises that are blurring the line between not-for-profit and for-profit ventures. The Social Enterprise Alliance defines a social enterprise as an organization that advances its social mission through entrepreneurial, earned income strategies. Social enterprises can be both for-profit firms with a social mission and not-for-profit organizations that take a business approach to achieving their social mission (Social Enterprise Alliance 2005). Social entrepreneurship has been gaining significant momentum in the USA and Europe and is spreading to other parts of the world as well. Social entrepreneurs are working across a number of sectors, including international public health. For managers of nongovern-mental organizations (NGOs) and community-based organizations (CBOs) in developing countries, it is important to examine this new trend and determine whether there are elements of this new model that are appropriate for them. Increasingly we are seeing that many NGOs and CBOs working in the public health field are focusing on improving sustainability within a changing funding environment. In this chapter, I examine the reasons behind this new focus on sustainability, provide a definition of sustainability, offer suggestions for planning for sustainability, and identify how social enterprise strategies can assist NGOs and CBOs to build a financially viable organization. © 2010 Springer-Verlag New York.},

abstract={"Business as usual" has come under heavy scrutiny. The financial crisis has caused many to question the basic premises of the current business system. In the following chapter, I will examine how organizations can cope with the current crisis by creating sustainable value. I propose that businesses learn from a newly emerging field called social entrepreneurship. The concept of social entrepreneurship is discussed and examined for its potential to support for sustainable value creation. A detailed case study of bracNet provides an example of shared-value creation. bracNet is a for-profit enterprise in Bangladesh aiming to close the digital divide globally and regionally. New business models and cross-sectoral partnerships allow bracNet to implement a social and financial value creation strategy. Key for success seems to be the shared ownership of bracNet, by BRAC, a nonprofit organization, and various for-profit entities (including VCs, industrial conglomerates, and hedge funds).},

A case study of a multi-stakeholder network focused on promoting processes of rural enterprise development, known as the Central America Learning Alliance, is used to illustrate social entrepreneurship in the context of the framework for innovation and learning that is developed in the first part of the paper.

abstract={Purpose – This paper aims to describe how Taoufik Mathlouthi created Mecca/Cola, a beverage designed as an alternative to major American colas. It is intended to raise student's consciousness about the fact that good opportunities can be driven by political and social changes. Second, it aims to bring them the opportunity to reflect about their own definition of a social entrepreneur and understand the challenges behind pursuing multiple objectives that is, trying to blend and integrate non/profit goals with rigorous venture development practices. Design/methodology/approach – To write this case, two complementary methodologies were relied on: interviews with founder and employees and use of secondary information such as press articles. Findings – The case describes how what began as a venture for French Muslims, garnered international appeal, with markets opening up in 54 countries in less than two years. However, despite this success, the following stage of transforming Mecca/Cola into a sustainable business while maintaining its “essence” was proving difficult for the company. Originality/value – The case is intended for an undergraduate or MBA course in entrepreneurship. The innovative aspect is that the entrepreneur discovered a business opportunity that arose in the wake of the Iraq war in the form of discontent with US foreign policy among some sectors of the population. As courses on social entrepreneurship begin to emerge in academic institutions this case also offers an interesting example of the challenges brought about initiating this kind of business and achieving a double bottom line. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

At any rate, it has also assured an academic recognition for sociology, if in a subaltern- situation vis - vis economics. Further theoretical reformulations by Parsons are confirmation of previously mentioned incoherence and misunderstandings, without resolving them. Copyright © 2008 SAGE Publications.},

abstract={In recent years, a debate has arisen in universities and in international circles over the efficacy of various strategies for development. The persisting spectres of poverty and disease have disillusioned many with the traditional model of development assistance channelled through large international institutions. In response to this malaise came the innovative idea of harnessing the power of the markets to alleviate poverty. However, opponents of the market approach to development cite the difficulty of entrusting the welfare of the world's poor to corporations concerned with their own bottom line. This paper discusses the unique role third-sector actors (universities and non-profits) can play in combining the goals set by international institutions with the energy and efficiency of market actors. The activities of a non-profit organisation, Venture Strategies for Health and Development, and an academic centre, the Center for Entrepreneurship in International Health and Development, both based in Berkeley, California, are profiled in order to assess and support the third sector's capacity to manage development programmes and act as a conduit between the private sector and international institutions and governments.},

abstract={A successful social entrepreneurship project in Dublin, Ireland, Fastrack into Information Technology (FIT) forms the backdrop for this article on the value, influence and significance of a dedicated first-person inquiry. The work makes the connections between the early poverty experiences of the author, a subsequent business career of high achievement and this followed by a deliberate choice to sell his assets and to commit himself to the resolution of serious social problems. Underpinning this new orientation is a faith-based spirituality reflected in the Spiritual Exercisesof St. Ignatius (Founder of the Jesuits). The article explores the close relationship between these Spiritual Exercisesand first-person inquiry practice. In tracing their influence over a time span of quarter of a century, it places first-person inquiry appropriately at the core of the activity while, at the same time, describing the organic links which forge growthful outcomes in second and third-person arenas. With a descriptive image of the bloc of influence which make up the FIT project – government, industry and local communities – and emphasizing its co-creative nature, the work concludes with a vision for the next stage. The realisation of this vision will continue to see first-person inquiry in a central and pivotal role. © 2005, SAGE Publications. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The relevance of this study lies in the fact that financial risk is a serious obstacle to the development of social entrepreneurship, preventing the implementation of potential support for sustainable development goals in business. The purpose of this article is to clarify specific aspects of financing factors and financial risk related to social entrepreneurship in developing countries (in comparison with the standard financial risk related to commercial entrepreneurship) in order to analyze the influence of the financing factors of social entrepreneurship on sustainable development, as well as to determine the potential for the development of social entrepreneurship through financial risk management. To achieve this goal, this article uses the methodology of econometrics—dataset modelling of financial risk management in social entrepreneurship to achieve sustainable development in emerging economies. On the basis of the results of this study, firstly, it is substantiated that the financial risks entailed by social entrepreneurship differ from the standard financial risk present in commercial entrepreneurship. Specific factors of the financing of sustainable development in emerging economies are determined and, on the basis of this, financial risks specific to social entrepreneurship in emerging economies are identified as follows: (1) reduced stimulus to use financial resources in long-term investments, which disrupts the stability and decreases inclusion; (2) joint public–private investments and decreased investment in R&D; and (3) expanded investment in the skills required for jobs and “markets of tomorrow”. Secondly, a contradictory influence of financing factors on sustainable development is demonstrated. Thirdly, a large potential for the development of social entrepreneurship by means of financial risk management (maximum reduction) was identified. With the minimization of financial risk, social entrepreneurship would demonstrate substantial progress, with an increase of 99.61% (more than 50%) from 45.18 points to 90.18 points. A novel contribution of this paper to the extant literature consists of the specification of the essence and specifics of social entrepreneurship in emerging economies through the identification of financial risks and the provision of recommendations for their management. © 2021 by the authors.

Drawing upon a resource-based view through an input-process-output lens and integrating resource dependence theory, this study explores the mechanism of strategic alliances, bricolage, and social impact scaling and investigates the role of entrepreneurial orientation within it. Using evidence drawn from a survey of 278 Chinese social firms, this research views strategic alliances and bricolage as an effective ‘strategic bundle’ for improving SEs’ social performance and sheds new light on the bricolage-mediated resource management mechanism within SEs. We suggest that social entrepreneurs practice alliance-specific bricolage strategies to convert resources into superior social performance. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Background: Universal health coverage is one of the Sustainable Development Goal targets known to improve population health and reduce financial burden. There is little qualitative data on access to and quality of primary healthcare in East and West Africa. The aim of this study was to describe the viewpoints of healthcare users, healthcare providers and other stakeholders on health-seeking behaviour, access to and quality of healthcare in seven communities in East and West Africa. Methods: A qualitative study was conducted in four communities in Nigeria and one community each in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania in 2018. Purposive sampling was used to recruit: 155 respondents (mostly healthcare users) for 24 focus group discussions, 25 healthcare users, healthcare providers and stakeholders for in-depth interviews and 11 healthcare providers and stakeholders for key informant interviews. The conceptual framework in this study combined elements of the Health Belief Model, Health Care Utilisation Model, four ‘As’ of access to care, and pathway model to better understand the a priori themes on access to and quality of primary healthcare as well as health-seeking behaviours of the study respondents. A content analysis of the data was done using MAXQDA 2018 qualitative software to identify these a priori themes and emerging themes. Results: Access to primary healthcare in the seven communities was limited, especially use of health insurance. Quality of care was perceived to be unacceptable in public facilities whereas cost of care was unaffordable in private facilities. Health providers and users as well as stakeholders highlighted shortage of equipment, frequent drug stock-outs and long waiting times as major issues, but had varying opinions on satisfaction with care. Use of herbal medicines and other traditional treatments delayed or deterred seeking modern healthcare in the Nigerian sites. Conclusions: There was a substantial gap in primary healthcare coverage and quality in the selected communities in rural and urban East and West Africa. Alternative models of healthcare delivery that address social and health inequities, through affordable health insurance, can be used to fill this gap and facilitate achieving universal health coverage. © 2021, The Author(s).},

Drawing on a database of 24 case studies collected in different European countries and different areas of wicked social problems, this article aims to discuss how PSINSIs fit into the entrepreneurial and routinized innovation and learning regimes described by evolutionary economics. It highlights the diverse variations of these general regimes, bringing to the fore different forms of social entrepreneurship (bricoleurs, constructionists and engineers) and different configurations of the routinized regime (organizational entrepreneurship, canonical, intrapreneurial, extrapreneurial, spin-off). It also highlights the relationships between these two regimes and their various configurations.

These outlets are managed by social entrepreneurs who serve as an intermediary between the citizen and the government. With social entrepreneurship and stakeholder theories as underpinnings and model validation with data from 232 respondents, the current work suggests that social entrepreneurs' satisfaction is derived from a positive public image and satisfaction with stakeholders. The two factors fulfill the entrepreneur's communion motives and are derived from their economic well-being, an agency motive, which itself is an outcome of the e-Government website service quality. This study also establishes the intervening role of process and the government support for enhancing the social entrepreneur's economic wellbeing. The study brings the unique perspectives of social entrepreneurship to e-Government service delivery and provides recommendations for policymakers to focus on the satisfaction of such intermediaries for sustainable inclusion into the digital mainstream. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Research on consumer innovation in health care has shown that patients are important sources of new or improved treatments, care services and diagnostic tools. This paper points to another hitherto overlooked class of consumer innovation in health care, which we call collective consumer innovation. These self-organized service innovations emerge under regulatory constraints, occur on the system level, are collaborative, and tend to cause institutional change. We use historic and contemporary cases from the field of health care in order to document the importance of collective consumer innovation and devise a model to analyze their economic role. Collective consumer innovation is more likely under stricter regulation and when the production cost disadvantage of consumers vis-à-vis the formal sector is smaller. The role of market size and the scale of technological change is more complex. If either is large, innovation will be undertaken by the formal sector, while no innovation at all takes place if either is small. The model demonstrates that consumer innovations can enhance social welfare by improving the tradeoff between safety and experimental leeway, though they under certain conditions can lower welfare. Empirically, there are numerous cases where collective consumer innovations in the form of novel health services, policies and governance systems were adapted by public or corporate health care providers. © 2021},

Our study is guided by an established model of the employment effects of new firm entry over time and provides a direct comparison to the employment effects of commercial entrants. Our results show that the net employment effect of new social firms follows a wave pattern over the study’s eight-year horizon, apparently produced by the same combination of direct and indirect effects previously theorized for new commercial entrants. The results also indicate that net employment effect per social firm entrant is larger than for commercial firms. The study provides a first empirical assessment of employment creation effects of new social firms and contributes to a more nuanced theoretical understanding of employment effects across types of entrants. By specifying the economic contribution of social firms our study can open up a new track in social entrepreneurship research and provide important input to employment policy. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={Men continue to dominate the supply-side narratives of energy access projects, leaving an unexplored gap in gendered organizations. To fill this gap, the article utilises interviews with women workers to consider their lived experience working for an energy access-based organisation. Through the use of narrative analysis, this study highlights the importance of socio-cultural contextualisation of social entrepreneurial activities and social missions. It takes a persuasive case-study approach to analysing Husk Power Systems (HPS), which operates primarily in Bihar, India. HPS, a mini grid-based social enterprise, began its operations in Bihar in 2007 with the goal of ameliorating rural Bihar's energy access problems and secondarily, empowering women through employment opportunities. Drawing on the concepts of women's empowerment, social inequalities, and intersectionality, this article argues that although HPS provides formal employment opportunities, its presence has not secured long-lasting women's empowerment in Bihar. As a social enterprise, HPS has limited capacity to reform social inequalities. Although HPS guarantees local job creation, we underscore further exploration of the intersectional dimensions influencing social enterprises’ energy access business operations’ longevity and impact, including those of local systems of power, caste, gender, and class. © 2021 The Author(s)},

We propose that the impact of gender composition in new venture teams (NVTs) on commercialization of social ventures is contingent on the strength of cultural norms of a nation. Our view of gender as a culture-contingent resource reveals ordering mechanisms that distinguish gender effects in culturally tight versus culturally loose societies with respect to commercialization intent and legal form. The empirical analysis of an international sample of 6657 social ventures from 30 countries supports the study hypotheses. The findings show that gender differences in new ventures are more significant in tight societies compared to loose societies. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Research Summary: Designing effective entrepreneurship training programs is still a challenge despite the investments in training made by governments and private institutions, and its importance for economic growth. We report a case of impact measurement of a social entrepreneurship program based on repeated randomized controlled trials (RCTs), discuss challenges of conducting repeated RCTs, and implications for policy evaluation. Impact measures from the first edition of the program showed no detectable treatment effects. The second edition was adjusted by reducing leadership training and increasing traditional entrepreneurial skills training, and had strong treatment effects on entrepreneurial activities, the creation of a new venture during the program, and subsequent start-up activity. Employing sequential field experiments can improve entrepreneurship training programs despite the challenges of executing RCTs in the field. Managerial Summary: Governments, institutions, and businesses increasingly invest in innovative entrepreneurship training programs that tackle societal problems. However, we know very little about the effectiveness of such trainings. To measure the causal impact of a social entrepreneurship training program we use an experiment where we assign one group of applicants randomly to training. A comparable group is selected randomly to not obtain the training. There were no detectable differences between the two groups the first time the program was run. After substantial changes were made, where analytical skills training was boosted at the expense of a reduction in social leadership skills training and social entrepreneurial identity development, and individualized coaching intensified, we find a large impact on entrepreneurial activities, both during the program and 3 years later. © 2020 Strategic Management Society},

This research investigates how an innovative social business model acts on institutional voids and creates social value for deprived communities. Building on insights from the literature and a longitudinal case study of a local, grassroots social business venture operating in Brazilian slums and shantytowns (favelas), we uncover and theorize eight mechanisms by which an innovative social business model brings about institutional change and creates social value. These mechanisms are: orchestrating local business networks, developing local business networks, upgrading and building cognitive capacity, legitimizing, assigning multiple roles, empowering, building a positive territorial identity (territorial de-stigmatization), and boundary spanning. Our findings have important implications for social entrepreneurs and organizations supporting social business ventures in transforming economies. Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

Linear regression is used to analyze the responses obtained from 300 general populations across three developing countries including Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan. The findings show that business ties positively affect SEIs, but political ties are negatively related to SEIs.

Relying on a willingness-ability paradigm, we discuss under which circumstances social innovation unfolds. Drawing on unique survey data collected from a sample of 164 social cooperatives in Italy, we find that investments in product/service and process innovation are positively related to social innovation outcomes. Moreover, the contingent effect of proactiveness and risk-taking suggests that willingness plays a controversial effect on the relationship between innovation input and outcome. Interestingly, the contingent role of low barriers to accessing distribution channels and funding on the one hand and competitor aggressiveness on the other shows the role of ability in unfolding social innovation.

abstract={This review of research used meta-synthesis to integrate findings from seven bibliometric reviews of research on managing for sustainability in different management disciplines: leadership, human resource management, entrepreneurship management, innovation management, supply chain management, knowledge management, and strategic management. The purposes of the review were to document empirically key features of this knowledge base as well as to identify leading journals, and documents. The meta-synthesis analyzed bibliographic data associated with 9927 relevant documents sourced from the Scopus index. The review confirmed the existence of a large body of management research on sustainability. This research, which first emerged during the 1980s, has grown exponentially since 2010. Although authorship of this corpus has been concentrated in Anglo- American-European (AAE) societies (60%), the authors of this corpus represent 140 different societies. Moreover, there is a recent trend of increasing contributions from developing societies such as China, India, Malaysia, Brazil, and South Africa. There are large differences in the “between-discipline” proportion of research produced on sustainability topics, with knowledge management and supply chain management evidencing the largest and human resource management the smallest proportions of this literature. The review also provided insight into the most influential journals (e.g., Journal of Cleaner Production, Sustainability, International Journal of Production Economics, Business Strategy and the Environment) and documents in the literature on managing for sustainability. Document co-citation analysis yielded three key conceptual themes within this literature: Sustainable Supply Chain Management, Strategic Management of Resources for Sustainability, Social Entrepreneurship. This analysis further highlighted the central role that strategic management theories have played in shaping sustainability discourse across the different management disciplines. © 2021 by the authors.},

abstract={Universities are coming under increasing pressure to produce impact that contributes to socio-economic development. Previous studies have focused on university technology transfer (UTT) mechanisms that lead to the commercialisation of intellectual property. We find that off-late, the legitimacy of such mechanisms, owing to high-failure rates of IP-based start-ups, has come into question. Universities are being invited to widen their academic entrepreneurship (AE) practices to include other forms of knowledge transfer. The increased attention on contemporary concepts such as social entrepreneurship calls for broadening UTT performance indicators to include multiple bottom-lines. These bottom-lines should amplify the societal benefits of AE. This new emphasis raises high-level questions about the societal role of universities and UTT. The aim in this paper is to, therefore, reframe the debate on UTT processes by highlighting a revised agenda for further research. This is done by analysing the extant literature on UTT, academic entrepreneurship, entrepreneurial universities and innovation. The analysis includes a critical review of 96 peer-reviewed articles. As a result, a macro perspective is presented which highlights UTT as-a-mechanism for universities’ contribution to collective societal goals. Propositions are outlined for future research; these can be used for developing new understanding on how universities can actively contribute to socio-economic development agendas. © 2021 KeAi Communications Co., Ltd},

abstract={This paper utilizes the lenses of knowledge capital and institutional theories to examine the role knowledge capital plays in the context of entry into social versus commercial entrepreneurship. We also investigate the moderating role of national culture in the relationship between knowledge capital and entrepreneurship. Using data from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, we find that social capital is relatively more important in social entrepreneurship than commercial entrepreneurship. We also find that national culture moderates this relationship such that in high individualism cultures, specific human capital is directed towards commercial entrepreneurship compared to social entrepreneurship. However, in high uncertainty avoidance cultures, social capital is directed towards social entrepreneurship rather than commercial entrepreneurship. Our findings uncover the nature of the contingent effects of informal institutions on the relationship between knowledge capital and entrepreneurship, leading to important implications for theory and development policy. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The emergence of organic planning practices in the Netherlands introduces new, non-conventional, local actors initiating bottom-up urban developments. Dissatisfied with conventional practices and using opportunities during the 2008 financial crisis, these actors aim to create social value, thus challenging prevailing institutions. Intrigued by such actors becoming more present and influential in urban planning and development processes, we aim to identify who they are. We use social entrepreneurship and niche formation theories to analyse and identify three types of social entrepreneurs. The first are early pioneers, adopting roles of a developer and end-user, but lacking position and power to realize goals. Second. by acting as boundary spanners and niche entrepreneurs, they evolve towards consolidated third sector organizations in the position to realize developments. A third type are intermediate agents facilitating developments as boundary spanners and policy entrepreneurs, without pursuing urban development themselves but aiming at realizing broader policy goals. Our general typology provides a rich picture of actors involved in bottom-up urban developments by applying theories from domains of innovation management and business transition management to urban planning and development studies. It shows that the social entrepreneurs in bottom-up urban development can be considered the result of social innovation, but this social innovation is set within a neoliberal context, and in many cases passively or actively conditioned by states and markets. © 2020 The Authors},

abstract={The objectives of the study are to analyze micro Type II Social Business SPOs’ pre-venture and post-venture experiences, and to demonstrate how they contribute to capturing value while simultaneously pursue two goals, i.e. to uplift the underprivileged and, at the same time, grow into self-sustaining businesses. The research also examines value creation through the focus of their goals on beneficiaries/investors and customers through high and low engagement. The study engages a four-year-long ethnographic approach and conducts in-depth interviews with 28 micro Type II Social Business SPOs in Bangladesh. By exploring the pre-venture stage, the findings illustrate how their drive, obstacles, skill development and gaining of self-dependence motivate social entrepreneurs to leverage their SPO ventures within this context. The post-venture stage identifies four types of business models (non-traditional non-profit, holistic social business, subsistence, and traditional small business), and addresses how Type II Social Business SPOs shape business model value creation. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Purpose: This study aims to examine gender differences in risk-taking and prosociality through a hypothetical labour market entry choice experiment. Design/methodology/approach: To explore differences between male and female subjects by risk levels and framing effects, a labour market entry choice task that manipulated risk conditions was administered to business school students whereby subjects chose between a managerial job at a company, starting a commercial business or starting a social enterprise. The experimental design isolated and tested the influence of the type of value creation, risk propensity and framing effects. The results were then statistically analysed to test for significant differences between the two gender groups. Findings: Results indicate that in low-risk conditions women prefer the prosocial entrepreneurial option while men opt for purely commercial entrepreneurial activities. As risk increases, differences between men and women initially converge and then reverse under conditions of extreme risk, where men select the social entrepreneurial choice at a higher rate than women. Research limitations/implications: The research was conducted within the single country context of Peru and carried out using a specific subset of potential entrepreneurs (i.e. business school students). Second and related, the experimental labour entry task was hypothetical. Whether decisions would hold if business school students faced an actual occupational choice remains open to further investigation. Practical implications: The practical implication of the paper suggests that Peruvian business school students react differently towards potential labour market opportunities depending on their gender. Perhaps, because of gender biases common in the Latin American context, women appear to respond more positively to low-risk prosocial opportunities. However, as risk increases, contextual factors appear to become less important and reveal core sets of prosocially anchored men and commercially anchored women. Originality/value: This research provides new insights into risk-taking and prosocial differences between men and women facing labour entry decisions, especially in a developing country context with strong gender norms, and is particularly useful to those with an interest in entrepreneurial propensity and in the identification and development of entrepreneurial women. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: This study investigates (1) the processes through which social enterprises develop resilient organizational logics and (2) the key resilience factors in the organizational logics of successful social enterprises. The organizational logic is conceptualized here as the dynamic system of roles, rules and social expectations that result from the organization's business model, impact model and organizational form. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopts an inductive approach to identify emerging resilience factors and processes in an exemplary case of social entrepreneurship (a work integration venture). The longitudinal data collection on this case took place from 2011 to 2016, based on approximately 440 h of participant observation and 10 semi-structured interviews. Findings: The inductive analysis suggests that social enterprises develop resilient organizational logics through multi-level recursive processes of bridging institutional work. These processes enable the development of an organizational logic that is internally robust while linking distant practices, needs and expectations. The authors conceptualize these characteristics into a novel construct, the organizational logic's bridging power, which is operationalizable through two dimensions (hybridity-based and cocreation-based bridging power) and five sub-dimensions. Research limitations/implications: Like in all inductive studies, further research is needed to validate the proposed model. The new proposed construct “organizational logic's bridging power” is, interestingly, a meta-theoretical concept encouraging cross-fertilization between the literature on institutional logics and that on value cocreation. Originality/value: The process development model proposed by this study highlights the importance of network-level institutional work for developing cocreation-based resilience. Furthermore, this study shows how institutional theories could be complemented with other bodies of knowledge in order to understand social enterprise resilience. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

However, their study did not address the work-related capacities of nonprofit organisation employees, which are critical to the success of this transformation. Therefore, we tested the effects of prior experience with social problems and work self-efficacy on SEI. The results reveal that the planning and communication aspects of work self-efficacy and prior experience with social problems had significant effects on SEI. Moreover, work self-efficacy mediated the relationship between prior experience with social problems and SEI.

Despite burgeoning SDP research, there have been few studies that have investigated the bicycles-for-development (BFD) “movement”, whereby bicycles are perceived as key to achieving international development goals (e.g., gender equality). In this article, an institutional logics lens is used for an analysis of BFD hybrid organizations, particularly social enterprises. Interviews with BFD organizational executives were conducted, and data analysis revealed three overarching themes centered around: (1) BFD social enterprise financial strategies to strive for market and social program sustainability; (2) environmental factors that influence BFD social enterprises; and (3) social-market tensions of BFD hybrid organizations. Expanding understandings of how hybrid organizations in SDP navigate dual bottom-lines, findings and discussion highlight how BFD social enterprises are challenged by the environment in which they operate and as such face questions of their ability to offer clearly articulated social missions that move away from traditional market-based practices. The paper concludes 8with suggestions for further research on BFD and future empirical investigations of social enterprises in sport.8. © 2021 Sport Management Association of Australia and New Zealand.},

abstract={Purpose: Coopetition is a well-studied phenomenon in traditional enterprises. However, it lacks deepening in the social sphere, specifically on hybrid organizations (social and commercial goals). This paper analyzes the configuration of coopetition strategies in social enterprises and how these strategies can improve social value devolution. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted a multicase study with Brazilian social enterprises and a social incubator. Semistructured interviews with founders of the social enterprises and the president of the incubator were the primary sources of evidence, supported by observations and secondary data. Findings: The authors identified four main findings: (1) the social incubator induces coopetition among social enterprises; (2) coopetition is necessary to improve market performance; (3) coopetition is a natural strategy resulting from the activity of the social enterprise; (4) the behavior and context of social enterprises generate a new framework for coopetition formation. This framework comprises three stages of value: a social cooperation level to co-creation of value; second, a social competition level to the appropriation of value; and the third coopetition-balanced level to social value devolution. Originality/value: The authors advance knowledge on coopetition in an exciting, underexplored context, social entrepreneurship. The authors highlight that the coopetition nature and outcome in social enterprises have specificities compared to traditional businesses. The authors also improve the understanding of social value devolution based on simultaneous cooperation and competition among small social enterprises, allowing theoretical and practical implications. Thus, they advance the recurring discussion in coopetition literature beyond the generation and appropriation of value. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Entrepreneurship research views context as central to understanding entrepreneurship as a fluid social construction. Our study answers recent call to focus on a diversity of organizational forms to deepen theorizing and to broaden the domain of what is considered entrepreneurship. Worker cooperatives are a type of social enterprise under exposed in the entrepreneurship literature. Thus, we investigate how context impacts collective social entrepreneurial processes over time by exploring how worker cooperative entrepreneurs view their contexts and their own entrepreneurial initiatives’ purposes. We introduce the term ‘participative social entrepreneurship’, which we define as ‘democratic and collaborative action, amongst both similar and diverse actors to foster positive societal change’. Findings based on a longitudinal study of worker cooperative entrepreneurs from two European territories over 2011-2020 highlight the relevance of context and purpose interplay in shaping worker cooperative entrepreneurs’ perceptions and so, the construction of participative social entrepreneurship. The study reveals that while, in theory, the worker cooperative form has a prosocial purpose naturally embedded in its democratic governance structure, social entrepreneurship in action does not always translate into voices that contest the status quo and highlights the necessity of paying attention to the factors that make participative social entrepreneurship dynamic and real. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

This study is both archival and exploratory and has pictured culture and communality as drivers that are needful for enterprising communities. Findings: This paper finds communality, social network, social capital and trust as push-factors for community-based entrepreneurship and development drives. Originality/value: This study is an original exposé on the Abia Ohafia community’s Model of community-based entrepreneurship which thrives on strong institutions (like the Age Grade System) and age-long practices that have built trust and stability. This local community through its networks, culture and communalities creates relationships, rational innovation, consensual leadership and participatory followership under which resources, opportunities and solutions are deliberately advanced for meeting social and community purposes. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Social enterprises are organisations that employ commercial strategies to deliver societal impact, rather than shareholder value, and may play an important role in the transition to a more socially sustainable society. However, social entrepreneurship has become a contested terrain due to its ambiguous identity and ideology. This study maintains that accounting plays a role in the development of social enterprises due to its ability to shape the domain of economic operation. Using interview data obtained from the key actors in Finland, this study identifies and analyses perceptions of the roles of accounting for social enterprises. Overall, the study highlights the ambiguities related to accounting for social enterprises and draws attention to the plural roles of accounting. It encourages opening up the processes of defining the principles and tools for accounting for social enterprises, arguing that such decisions may have broader organisational and societal implications. © 2021 The Author(s).

abstract={The demand for entrepreneurship to become more prevalent in societies worldwide highlights the need to better understand entrepreneurial intentions (EI). This is particularly important for African nations characterised by significant poverty and low income. Drawing on the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) this paper explores potential predictors of these intentions in two countries that differ considerably in their economic situation and culture. It chiefly focuses on SEI as socially desired, yet still unexplored phenomenon. The current study differentiates between social (SEI) and commercial (CEI) entrepreneurial intentions and explores their antecedents among university students in Namibia (n = 223) and Germany (n = 1326). The results suggest that TPB only poorly predicts SEI, particularly in Namibia. However, they support universally positive effect of perceived behavioural control on formation of CEI in both countries. This study contributes to emerging research into antecedents of SEI. It also highlights the need to test exploratory power of recognised theories such as TPB within different contexts and types of entrepreneurial activity. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={This article emerges from the simple observation that community-based social and environmental activists often engage with practices of mindfulness, either personally or collectively. It draws on two case studies, a UK-based Transition initiative and a community of social entrepreneurs in Germany. On the surface, social and environmental activists, committed to change in the ‘real world’, outward facing and public, jar with practices of ‘mindfulness’: personal and interior actions –‘private’. We argue that post-foundationalist understandings of community, particularly Nancy’s being-in-common – popularised within geography as ‘community economies’ – and the philosophical and spiritual roots of mindfulness are two lines of thought that provide clues to this co-occurrence. Going beyond understandings of collectivity that build on the coming together of preformed individuals or presuppose a common substance, we set the (Westernised) Buddhist influences on mindfulness, specifically the notion of interbeing, side by side with Nancy’s being-in-common. This article argues that both the political and spiritual aspects of activism are integral parts of social change. It concludes that post-foundational and Buddhist-inspired lines of thought cross-fertilise and chart a course towards transformative mindfulness. © The Author(s) 2020.},

abstract={Despite the growing interest in social entrepreneurship research in the social work literature, very little research examines how social entrepreneurs tackle social work challenges in the HIV/AIDS sector. Consequently, we lack research on how social entrepreneurship might contribute to social work’s domain of healthcare. In this article, we employ grounded theory research to study how a group of social entrepreneurs (N = 58) selected as Fellows by Ashoka, one of the world’s most influential social entrepreneurship support organizations, solve HIV/AIDS problems. This article identifies four major interventions that social entrepreneurs employed in tackling HIV/AIDS problems: relational, service, economic, and policy. We analyzed these four primary interventions and classified them into a typology based on (1) locus of change (institutional-oriented or macro social work vs agent-oriented or micro social work), (2) resources used (material/utilitarian vs symbolic/normative), and (3) client–social enterprise relations (client as recipient vs client as co-creator). This article contributes to social work research by demonstrating the possibility of integrating multilevel (e.g. micro and macro) and multidimensional (e.g. service, economic, and policy) interventions in addressing HIV/AIDS problems. It also suggests avenues for future research to lessen the gap between social work and social entrepreneurship research so as to advance social work research. © The Author(s) 2019.},

abstract={Social enterprises implement business-like approaches to address social problems. Scale-up of these enterprises beyond one geographical context can extend their impact to better match the scope of problems being addressed. Unfortunately, many social enterprises start but relatively few expand to new contexts, making scale-up one of the most important but least understood outcomes of social entrepreneurship. We explore this outcome empirically, extending existing research that is predominantly conceptual. The study adopts a multicase study research design. A dynamic capabilities framework reveals how resources are amassed and configured for expansion, a process that can be more difficult for social compared to commercial enterprises. Findings suggest scale-up may be a second act of social entrepreneurship because dissimilarities between initial and scale-up contexts necessitate product modification, different partnerships, and idiosyncratic resource configurations. We thus call into question existing literature's focus on standardization - generic resource configurations - for scaling-up social enterprises to new geographical contexts.

abstract={The Colombian armed conflict is the oldest internal confrontation in the entire American continent and has placed Colombia as one of the countries in the world with the highest volume of internally displaced persons. There are many factors that influence the possibility of suffering violence in this situation, but one of the main factors is undoubtedly gender. In addition, the destruction of the productive fabric and the impoverishment of conflict zones are a difficult reality when it comes to undertaking initiatives. Women not resigning themselves to this state of affairs, by their own initiative, work to go from passive victims to survivors and agents of change. To achieve this, they hold on to social entrepreneurship as a possible vehicle and alternative for empowerment and personal development, the union with other women and the support of their families’ being crucial factors to reach this purpose. In this context, two research questions have been raised, related to the role of social entrepreneurship in women’s development and in building peace. These questions are answered by obtaining empirical data from key informants (seven personal interviews with Colombian women victims of the conflict from different departments who have promoted social entrepreneurship projects). The interviews were conducted from September to November 2019. Thus, one of the main conclusions is that entrepreneurship alone is not enough; State involvement is also necessary if the effects of the work carried out by these women are to reach a greater number of people and be more durable, contributing to economic and social progress and, therefore, to peace processes. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={One important domain of nonmarket-driven innovation is social innovation. Defined as “new ideas that have the potential to improve either the quality or the quantity of life,” social innovation stands in stark contrast to business innovation that focuses on creativity with the intention of making a profit. Drawing on research on motivation, creativity, rentier mentality, and Islamic work ethics, this article takes a motivational approach to social innovation and advances a proposition that prosocial motivation is of particular importance in fostering social innovation in the context of the UAE. We argue that due to policies that grant nationals high financial stability and affluence, UAE locals are less likely to be driven by extrinsic motivation, but rather by intrinsic motivation. We propose that enhancing their prosocial motivation will have a synergetic effect with their intrinsic motivation and therefore lead to higher social innovation. This article extends the literature on prosocial motivation, social innovation, and social entrepreneurship by identifying a geographical/cultural region where the motivational basis for social innovation is amplified. Significantly, this article questions common assumptions about a rentier mentality and proposes a path to leverage social innovation.

abstract={In recent years, a significant revolution has begun in social entrepreneurship, with public funding organizations and private investors beginning to pursue social purpose. At the heart of the revolution is the ambition of these entities to use innovation and entrepreneurship to sustain and scale impacts in support of social and environmental objectives. This article provides a framework that conceptualizes social innovation and finance as a multi-level and evolving complex system. Two trajectories of transformation, niche-regime and within-regime, are used to frame a broad range of examples of impact entrepreneurship and social financing. Social finance is viewed as the key to release the ‘lock-in’ of social innovation, as it is able to gather and coordinate capital, resources, knowledge and ability. Using meta-analysis, the article explores the characteristics, dynamics and ecosystem of social innovation, impact entrepreneurship in China.

abstract={Social entrepreneurs are generally believed to have started their venture to improve societal needs and create social value. Yet, in order to achieve continuity of their organization, they need to generate economic value as well. These seemingly opposite objectives of social and economic value creation can cause tensions in social enterprises. This study aims to derive in-depth insights into personal dispositions and motivations of social entrepreneurs, with a specific focus on empathy. The study assesses differences in motivations of social entrepreneurs and how moral empathy helps them to cope with tensions that arise from trying to achieve both commercial and social goals. Analysis of semi-structured interviews with 33 social entrepreneurs in Belgium explores the tension between social and economic objectives as a paradox social entrepreneurs have to deal with. First, empathy is an important motivator, but not for all entrepreneurs. Social entrepreneurs who are driven by empathy often indicate that experiencing a critical life event has led to certain business choices. The life event does not always directly lead to increased empathy but often changes an entrepreneur’s career or life path. Second, while social entrepreneurs are supposed to stress social impact, some respondents firmly state that financial impact is more important to their organization. The results show that social entrepreneurs display other motivations that are typical for “traditional” (commercial) entrepreneurs as well, such as self-realization and the sense of doing meaningful work. Empathy seems to play an important role in successfully dealing with the paradox and tensions between social and economic value creation, and more specifically to prevent mission drift. © Copyright © 2020 Lambrechts, Caniëls, Molderez, Venn and Oorbeek.},

Findings point towards the role of situated cognition. Using a ‘think-aloud’, scenario-based experiment and two assessments of cognitive effort, our research reveals a unique “person-in-situation” decision-making process in failing situations. The entrepreneurs’ sequences of cognitive activities and cognitive effort are distinctively influenced by the nature of the failing venture as they reach the decision to persist or exit, regardless of the entrepreneurs’ baseline motivations. This is counterintuitive against the predominance of explanations emphasizing the relevance of orientation and intentions to address social needs or maximize profit as well as the role of escalation of commitment in the termination/persistence decision. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The study of social entrepreneurship has rapidly evolved in the last years, with a significant number of articles published. Based on a review of the existing literature in the theoretical framework of social entrepreneurship, this article attempts to clarify this phenomenon in the empirical framework of gastronomy. Gastronomy has emerged as a useful tool in social change at all levels, revolutionizing certain theoretical precepts in social entrepreneurship. A term so used in recent years that forces to rethink its meaning; what is and what is not social entrepreneurship; and the profile and the role of the social entrepreneur when detecting the social opportunity. In the preparation of this paper, several examples have been used to help understand this phenomenon. Likewise, thanks to this paper, doors are opened to future research areas in the field of social entrepreneurship in gastronomy. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={One of the emerging research areas in the strategic orientation is how to transfer different orientations from the commercial sector to the non-profit sector. Therefore, the objective of this study is to determine the mediating effect of Learning Orientation on the Market Orientation, Social Entrepreneurial Orientation, and Organizational Performance in the non-profit sector. The data from more than 300 employees of the non-profit organizations was collected through snowball sampling method from different parts of Pakistan and was analyzed using Smart PLS software to perform Structural Equation Modeling. The findings indicate that acquiring strategic resources is also relevant for non-profit sector, but these resources are useless if they can be easily imitated. Therefore, an organization should develop such capabilities to make resources imperfectly imitable. Research also shows that Market Orientation and Social Entrepreneurial Orientation are key strategic resources, but in the presence of Learning Orientation, an organization can exploit these resources more effectively. The study also discusses practical implications, limitations, and future directions. © 2020 Iranian journal of Management Studies.},

abstract={Purpose: Individuals adopt differing perceptions of entrepreneurial types, including small businesses, scalable businesses and social businesses. This study aims to suggest that individuals' entrepreneurial personal theory (EPT: learning from experiences that informs how an individual conceptualizes entrepreneurship) influences entrepreneurial intent, and that sensemaking facilitates this process such that those with a clearer understanding of different entrepreneurship paths are more likely to pursue opportunities. Design/methodology/approach: This study theorizes and empirically tests whether EPT affects an individual's intent to start a small business, a scalable business or a social enterprise and how gender moderates the relationship between EPT and entrepreneurial intent. Primary survey data were collected from undergraduate business students and working adults. Findings: The results indicate that EPTs characterized by small business, scalable business and social entrepreneurship have a positive association with entrepreneurial intentions. However, gender interaction effects showed that for women, an EPT characterized as small business has a weaker relationship with entrepreneurial intent, whereas an EPT characterized as social entrepreneurship has a stronger relationship with entrepreneurial intent. The notions that gender directly affects personal conceptions of entrepreneurship and that women may have not been exposed to all facets of entrepreneurship are addressed. Research limitations/implications: Other variables not included in this study could also influence the relationship between how the type of entrepreneurship may shape entrepreneurial intent and how such relationship may be influenced by gender. Implications for entrepreneurship education and curriculum development are presented. Originality/value: Integrating the EPT and sensemaking to uncover gender differences in the development of entrepreneurial intentions is a novel theoretical discussion. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Besides exploring the direct impacts of social capital, social entrepreneurial self-efficacy, and perceived desirability on social entrepreneurial intention, this study also focus on discovering the mediating roles of perceived desirability and social entrepreneurial self-efficacy on this relationship. Throughout adopting measures from some previous studies, the authors design the questionnaires and distribute to students in Vietnam. The study presents some demographic information of 289 students, who are studying at university and colleges in Vietnam. Then, the validity and reliability of scales are assessed using the value of Cronbach's alpha, Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). In addition, by utilizing the structural modeling structure (SEM), the authors show that social capital plays the important role in shaping social entrepreneurial self-efficacy, perceived desirability, and social entrepreneurial intention. Interestingly, besides the direct effects on social entrepreneurial intention, perceived desirability and social entrepreneurial self-efficacy also mediate the correlation between social capital and social entrepreneurial intention. Also, with the interesting findings of the study, the authors propose several recommendations for policy-makers, educators and academics to promote the social entrepreneurship and innovation among Vietnamese students. © The Author(s).},

abstract={The solidarity economy has been interpreted as being characterised by a political dimension: however, empirical and theoretical analysis supporting this statement is still embryonic. Drawing on a qualitative study in the city of Barcelona, this article analyses the political dimension of the solidarity economy and its transformative character with respect to neoliberalism by engaging with critical approaches related to the social movement studies. The main objectives were to investigate factors enabling the upsurge of solidarity economy organisations and how the opposition of social movement participants to neoliberal rationalities impacts on the way the solidarity economy is conceived and implemented in practice. The results highlight three main dimensions in which the political dimension is reflected, and some general as well as context-specific factors enabling the upsurge of solidarity economy organisations. Findings show how the compensative rationale that distinguishes most approaches in the field of social entrepreneurship studies is contested by the solidarity economy: its transformative character is reflected in discourses and practices that define the solidarity economy as a prefigurative socio-economic project. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={The purpose of this research is to examine the relationships among social entrepreneurship, social business (SB) and multiple functions of urban agriculture in Japan, by introducing the methodologies of SEM (structural equation modeling) and TEM (trajectory equifinality model). Following conclusions are obtained based on the analytical results. First, people who are thinking creatively (TC) with a high level of social capital pay attention to social business and prefer multiple functions of urban agriculture not only in megacities but also in designated cities. These people are assumed to have a high level of social entrepreneurship as well. Second, social business develops through the virtuous cycle of social institutions, social entrepreneurship and social business. Among the social institutions, social capitals are important both in the beginning of SB establishment and in the processes of business development. Policy implication drawn from the research suggests that the government should provide opportunities to create a virtuous cycle between social institutions, social entrepreneurship and social business, especially to improve the accumulation of social capital, in order to attract the TCs who have a high level of social entrepreneurship and solve the problems through social business such as agriculture-related businesses. © 2020, The Japan Section of the Regional Science Association International.},

abstract={Purpose: The aim of this paper is to develop understanding of how open-access (OA) studios as creative social enterprises (CSEs) can negotiate coexisting creative, social and economic missions, and manage the motivations of stakeholders. In particular, it explores how this affects management practices and ways in which diverse social actors engage with the organisation and each other. This paper expands on the existing literature on social enterprises in relation to multiple value and stakeholder management and also contributes to the makerspace and wider creative industries literature. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses a qualitative, single-case case study of an OA studio established as a social enterprise based on analysis of secondary texts, interviews and observation. Findings: It is identified that a multifaceted value system creates both challenges and opportunities in relation to communal resource management and community development. Tensions between the creative and economic priorities of members and both the economic imperatives of the organisation and its social mission are also highlighted. It is suggested that despite these challenges, the OA model presents an opportunity to develop more collective forms of creative practice and support a reframing of the creative economy. Research limitations/implications: As a single case study in the geographical context of the United Kingdom, limited generalisations on OA management in other countries can be made without further investigation. Practical implications: There are practical implications for OA and other CSE founders in relation to resource and membership management and facilitating inclusive access. There are creative industries policy implications in the encouragement of more sustainable collaborative approaches. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the literature on social entrepreneurship, makerspaces and the creative industries by developing the understanding of OA studios and CSE management and the internal dynamics that influence organisational and social outcomes. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Social enterprises demonstrate how sustainability can be embedded into business. This often implies selecting a legal form and a business model dedicated to serving social and environmental (societal) objectives. Tailor-made legal frameworks for social enterprises in European Union (EU) Member States require that the social enterprise include a “societal purpose” in its constitutional documents. These legal frameworks refer to “societal purpose” in a general way; the wording is similar but not identical. The EU Regulation on Social Impact Funds and the EU Procurement Directive contain provisions that relate to social enterprises and they also refer to “societal purpose,” although neither of them defines the term. Some EU countries have not (yet) adopted tailor-made legislation. Their legislators have indicated that they struggle with demarcating the notion of “societal purpose". This article aims to support them as well as EU legislators by testing the concept of “societal purpose” in two ways. A doctrinal research was conducted in order to find a legal basis for explaining what “societal purpose” entails in the United Kingdom (UK) and the Netherlands. In the UK, the legal framework concerning the “Community Interest Company” was examined. In the Netherlands, which jurisdiction has not introduced a tailor-made legal framework for social enterprises, the existing tax legal framework for organisations with a “public benefit purpose” was analysed in the evaluation. Second, an empirical study was conducted into the societal purpose of 400 randomly selected UK and Dutch social enterprises. The results were categorised, compared with each other, and evaluated on the basis of existing legal frameworks. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment},

abstract={Background: Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 17 focuses on North/South partnerships for sustainable development. Literature on research partnerships and capacity-building often neglects how these processes are carried out in practice, their social impacts and participants' subjective experiences. Recognizing the increasingly global dimensions of Higher Education Institutions, the University Development and Innovation-Africa project (UDI-A) was designed to train lecturers and administrative staff of Angolan and Mozambican Universities through collaborations with European institutions, aiming at strengthening African academic and social landscapes through knowledge translation and dissemination. This paper examines potential outcomes of UDI-A on participants' academic pathways, investigating the conflict between different imaginaries of capacity-building and partnerships, focusing on how Angolan and Mozambican health sciences researchers experience international collaborations. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with seven health academics, as well as a focus group discussion involving all participants. These were recorded, fully transcribed, anonymized and coded to identify common themes. A consent form was signed by all participants. Results and discussion: UDI-A was considered innovative, fostering the improvement of pedagogical skills and increasing social entrepreneurship activities. Participants arrived with a specific institutional mandate and believed that the training received should be incorporated into institutional practices to "modernize" these specific Portuguese speaking African Universities and the health sector. The institutional mechanisms put in place to attain this goal, Centres for Academic Development and Innovation ("CADIs"), were considered potential research and development hubs and drivers of academic and societal transformation. Nevertheless, participants shared a sense of asymmetry (infrastructural, financial, in terms of access to information) between them and European trainers. Although this asymmetry was the underlying basis of this capacity-building project, they argued that UDI-A did not fully acknowledge their local contexts, compromising the prospective development of partnerships in the health field. Conclusions: More attention should be devoted to understanding how participants experience capacity building processes, integrating the diversity of their aspirations and perceptions into subsequent phases of the project, requiring the development of methodological innovations to increase the impact of these programs. © 2020 The Author(s).},

abstract={Purpose: The concept of the commons, or common goods, is becoming increasingly widespread in the world of research and among civil society. The commons are defined as resources that are shared and collectively managed by communities of users, such as natural commons (e.g. fisheries, the climate) and knowledge commons (e.g. Wikipedia, open-source software). The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach: This paper presents the findings of the PhD dissertation “Social finance and the commons,” recipient of the 2017 Emerald/EFMD Outstanding Doctoral Research Award, category Management and Governance, sponsored by Management Decision. Adopting an interdisciplinary perspective of the commons, this dissertation investigates how community enterprises govern financial resources as commons to serve the common good. To do so, it builds on data collected on community development banks in Brazil and complementary currencies in multiple countries. Findings: The findings explain how collective action favors the implementation of new forms of governance and management potentially enabling finance to create and support communities. In doing so, this dissertation provides insights on the transformative power of some governance features for the creation of commons. Originality/value: This dissertation advances theoretical and conceptual foundations for a theory of the commons in management sciences. It contributes to a new conceptualization of the commons, especially by extending the concept of commons to finance and showing the variety of commons according to governance structures and values. It also generates theoretical insights into social and community entrepreneurship research through an in-depth investigation of social finance organizations. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={This case focuses on how social entrepreneurs use business model thinking to create successful business models for sustainable social enterprise. It explores how the Hextol Foundation, an independent charitable company whose aim is to improve the quality of life of young people who are learning disabled, or who have mental ill health, uses business model thinking as part of a decision-making process to develop a sustainable social enterprise business model. The case provides a detailed account of the unique challenges presented to entrepreneurs who are driven by social purpose rather than solely by the need to generate a profit. The case is also useful in highlighting how business model thinking is used by entrepreneurs to identify, evaluate and pursue a range of strategic options. It advances our understanding of business model thinking and business model innovation in the context of a social enterprise. © The Author(s) 2019.},

abstract={Since 2000, Gawad Kalinga (GK) has emerged as a prominent player in promoting diaspora-driven strategies for social and economic development in the Philippines. GK has its roots as the social ministry of a Catholic lay organization that started by providing housing and youth programmes for the urban poor, but in recent years, it has moved towards a more secular model of fostering social entrepreneurship. Nevertheless, a distinctly moral imperative still underpins GK’s work, both in soliciting donations and volunteerism, and in selecting and supporting its development beneficiaries. A significant portion of GK’s funds, and volunteer labour, comes from the Filipino diaspora. This paper raises questions concerning the model of social and economic development that GK represents. In particular, we examine the drawbacks of private charitable involvement in the execution of state responsibilities such as social housing and poverty alleviation; and we ask what forms of moral subjectivity are created and populated in this model of development and how does it select, socialize and discipline beneficiaries? More broadly, this paper argues that the GK case addresses some of the promises and pitfalls of diaspora-driven development visions. © 2020, © 2020 SOAS University of London.},

Design/methodology/approach: This is a quantitative study with a validated questionnaire that records the perception levels of five social entrepreneurship subcompetencies. The survey, which includes 28 indicators, was applied to 140 university students from different disciplines. Hypothesis testing was applied to identify significant differences between men and women in each subcompetency by disciplinary area. Findings: In the global sample, significant differences by gender were observed only in the social value subcompetency. In the disciplinary analysis, significant differences were found in architecture and design, business, and engineering and science. Research limitations/implications: The questionnaire only gathered data about the students' perceptions. To the extent that perception is triangulated with other instruments, it is possible to increase knowledge regarding how to train in social entrepreneurship. Practical implications: The results can be useful for university training and increasing the envisioning and formulating of government projects by young people who create new businesses. Originality/value: This research contributes to the literature on the role of gender-specific perceptions of social entrepreneurship in Mexico. © 2020, José Carlos Vázquez-Parra, Abel García-González and María Soledad Ramírez-Montoya.},

The research for this paper includes interviews with the founder of Sekar Kawung foundation, literature reviews, photographs, social media reports and community summaries. Sui Utik, in collaboration with Sekar Kawung, has developed creative works including weavings, an innovative application of tattoos, food and beverage products, and eco treks. The research found that the Sui Utik community, which started producing creative works in 2015, have continued their practice as social entrepreneurs. It is suggested that they should now expand their practice by working together with other indigenous entrepreneurs to challenge Indonesian craftsmen and designers to take their creativity, skills and knowledge to an international market. As part of this move, the development of innovative marketing tools using new technologies should be explored, while maintaining local wisdom as the core value for making creative works. © 2020.},

abstract={Purpose: Nowadays, creation and discovery theories are the two main theoretical approaches supporting the studies on the emergence of enterprises and some scholars analyze these theories in isolation. In addition, studies that investigate the emergence of social enterprises based on these theories together are scarce. This paper aims to analyze if and how discovery and creation theories can coexist in the formation process of social enterprises. Design/methodology/approach: A multi-case study based on semi-structured interviews with the founders of eight Brazilian social enterprises was conducted. Findings: From the results, it is identified that there is a continuous process between discoveries and creations that lead to the maturation of the initial idea and, consequently, to the formation of a social enterprise. Therefore, a continuous process model between discovery and creation of opportunities in the formation of a social enterprise (i.e. a mixed theoretical approach) is proposed, going beyond a theoretical duality between creation or discovery. Originality/value: This study helps to overcome limitations inherent in both discovery and creation theories, proposing a mixed theoretical approach. This new theoretical approach praises the existence of new paths to understand the emergence of social enterprises, by overcoming the theoretical duality between creation or discovery of opportunities, i.e. a new understanding of an integrating process rather than a dichotomous one. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={South Western Sydney (SWS) is one of the fastest growing regions in the state of New South Wales (Australia). Much of the population live in local government areas (LGAs) with levels of disadvantage higher than the state average, with a predominance of non-communicable and chronic diseases that are typically associated with age-related and behavioural factors. This necessitates the management of social determinants of health through the integrated provision of primary and social care. The SWS Local Health District and Primary Health Network is exploring the potential of community health alliances (CHAs) as an innovative approach to support the provision of integrated health services. CHAs are a population health approach for addressing health challenges faced by people who share a common area of residence, sociocultural characteristic or health need, and are characterised by a shared mission, shared resource needs and acquiring/developing necessary organisational knowledge and skills. We explore how CHAs operate as social enterprises that utilise digital health and citizen engagement to deliver integrated people-centred health services (IPCHS) by conducting two case studies of CHAs operating in SWS: in Wollondilly and Fairfield LGAs. Using this approach, we aim to unpack the conceptual convergence that enables social enterprises to utilise digital health interventions and citizen engagement strategies to co-produce IPCHS with a view to developing theory and a framework for engaging digital citizens in integrated primary health care via social enterprise. © The Author(s) 2020.},

abstract={Name generators (NGs) and position generators (PGs) have been used to measure resources embedded in personal relationships, namely social support and social capital, respectively. Comparisons of these measures adopted NGs that only elicit a small number of alters (max. 5). In this paper we explore whether the measurement of social capital with NGs eliciting larger personal networks (say 15 to 20 alters) gives more comparable results to the PG in terms of occupational prestige. To address this issue, we designed a personal network questionnaire that combined a multiple name generator (MNG) and a PG and enquired about alter characteristics and alter-Alter ties for the two sets of nominations simultaneously, allowing their integrated analysis. The questionnaire was implemented in the software EgoNet to collect data from social/environmental entrepreneurs in Spain (N = 30) and Mexico (N = 30. The analysis shows that the two approaches capture mostly non-overlapping sets of personal network members, suggesting that the PG measured in this case available, but not accessed social capital. Remarkably the NG led to a higher average prestige for this occupational group than the PG, but also a lower heterogeneity in prestige. The consequences of using one or another approach and their interpretations are discussed. ©},

The purpose of this paper is to analyse the role of project management in social enterprises that combine these two organisational forms–the business and the charity - and contribute to the understanding of how social enterprises use project management practices to run their activities. A survey was conducted among Czech social enterprises listed in the Directory of social enterprises website, operated by P3–People, Planet, Profit, o.p.s, a non-profit organisation dedicated to popularising social entrepreneurship and innovation. A questionnaire was sent to 203 organisations claiming to be social enterprises. In total, 61 responses were received. Descriptive statistics and the chi-square test were used for the analysis. The research has provided for the first time an empirical analysis of project management practices in social enterprises. It suggests that social enterprises use project management tools for their activities; the statistical tests show, however, that there is no statistically significant relationship between annual turnover, number of employees and support from European Union funds and project management practices. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

abstract={The objective of this chapter is to determine the probability of starting social or commercial entrepre¬neurship in developing countries using the institutional approach as the theoretical framework. The study tests the hypotheses through a binomial logistic regression based on a sample of 10,598 entrepreneurs obtained from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM). The main findings demonstrate that a higher level of education (formal institution) and a positive perception of personal values (informal institution) increase the probability of being a social entrepreneur. Also, the study shows that the interaction between informal institutions causes changes in the likelihood of being a social or commercial entrepreneur. This research advances the discipline by providing new information on the institutional environmental factors that influence social entrepreneurial activity. © 2020, IGI Global.},

abstract={Owing to the contextual challenges, human service professionals (HSP) are creating social value (SV) for diverse vulnerable population groups through social innovation. This qualitative exploratory study investigates the nature of SV created by 14 HSPs, representing a diverse range of human service organizations (HSOs), and examines ‘why’ and ‘how’ they innovate. In addition, the study examines HSPs’ current understanding and practices related to social entrepreneurship (SE). The study findings highlight that increased accountability and new funding opportunities challenged HSPs to innovate. HSPs created SV by addressing new unmet needs, developing new collaborations, and employing alternative marketing strategies, thereby ensuring the financial sustainability of their programs and organizations, and promoting social and economic justice. Different understandings of SE were voiced based on the educational backgrounds of HSPs. Without formal training in SE, HSPs trained in social work appeared to use various components of the SE process, though in a haphazard fashion compared to those with a non-social work academic training. We suggest that the graduate curriculum across various disciplines should formally include principles and behaviors related to social innovation and entrepreneurship. Finally, more research is needed to understand and describe how HSPs create SV in HSOs. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

The findings reveal that the relationship between prior experience and perceived desirability is mediated by moral obligation whereas the relationship between moral obligation and social entrepreneurial intention is mediated by perceived desirability. This study highlights that moral obligation and perceived desirability significantly act as mediators but not empathy.

The analytical basis of the study comprised the fundamental provisions and concepts of open innovation and human capital, the theory of public goods, the theoretical provisions concerning the structure and substance of social action, corporate social responsibility, the concept of uneven innovation activity, the principles of social partnership, social viability and complementarity. The research problems were solved using the methods of systems, structural and functional, institutional, comparative and content analyses. The selection of analysed papers was conducted in the databases of the analytical information platform Web of Science, the National Scientific Citation Database Russian Science Citation Index, the Scopus abstract base, the databases of academic networks ResearchGate, Academia.edu, etc. The paper indicates that Russian and foreign discourses address the problem of social entrepreneurship primarily in the context of economic, managerial, sociological, psychological and pedagogical research practices. It observes differentiation in the approaches to the conceptualisation and definition of the notion of social entrepreneurship under the applicable subject axiomatics and methodology and identifies the specifics of defining the notion of social entrepreneurship in interdisciplinary discourse. The research results make the foundation for further development of the methodology of definitions in the area of social entrepreneurship and serve to ensure consistency in the respective subject field and its relevance to the complex nature of social entrepreneurship as a phenomenon calling to be addressed from systemic and interdisciplinary positions. © BEIESP.},

abstract={Why some communities have greater rates of social entrepreneurship in similar domains is a question of importance to scholars and practitioners alike. Much of the literature in social entrepreneurship begins with a social problem that has been identified, and then analyzes the antecedents of the entrepreneurial process that lead to organizational solutions emerging for those problems. However, why some problems gain traction as being worthy of time and effort in solving, has garnered little attention. We argue that particular problems are more or less salient triggers of action by prospective social entrepreneurs based on the distribution of such problems in the local social environment, rather than aggregate levels of need. Yet, even problems widely experienced as shared, salient, and generally worthy of action might lack the emergence of solutions in fragmented communities, such as those with high levels of residential segregation by race and income. We study this in the context of founding of advocacy and support organizations in the domain of healthcare, and find support for our predictions. We also conducted additional tests to better characterize the findings and test robustness to alternative sources of influence, such as the local pool of potential social entrepreneurs, the role of local ecology, and geographic spillovers from neighboring areas. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={For more than two decades, entrepreneurship has been promoted as an effective means to advance the aims of urban development. Social entrepreneurship, more specifically, is seen as a driver of urban innovation and experimentation at the local level. Nevertheless, in-depth research about the opportunities that arise from the coordination of urban planning with social entrepreneurship policy at the local level is lacking. Inspired by this realisation, the research presented in this paper investigates six European cities (Terrassa, Spain; Göteborg, Sweden; Torino, Italy; Lisbon, Portugal; Porto, Portugal; and Hengelo, the Netherlands) that have adopted a coordinated approach to promote social entrepreneurship in their territory. We identify the developmental benefits sought by these cities in promoting social entrepreneurship, the ways in which urban planning supports social entrepreneurship policy and vice versa, and the key challenges that cities face in pursing this. We conclude that the coordination of urban planning with social entrepreneurship policy is an emergent, interdisciplinary field with high growth potential given the current socio-economic challenges facing cities. However, the lack of awareness, expertise, actionable data and formal processes stand in the way of realising this potential. © 2020, © 2020 ETH–Eidenössiche Technische Hochschule Zürich.},

abstract={Purpose: Although scholars have investigated how social entrepreneurs create and develop social enterprises in the penurious stable environment, how they are created in the penurious unstable environment has yet been overlooked. The purpose of this paper is to address this research gap by exploring how internally displaced individuals, despite the lack of resources, create and develop a social enterprise to serve the other displaced population in the war and conflict zones. Design/methodology/approach: Underpinned by a biographical research design, in-depth interviews with internally displaced individuals who have created social enterprises in the war and conflict zones were undertaken. Three social entrepreneurs were chosen for this study from three different social enterprises that are created by internally displaced individuals to serve the other internally displaced people of three different countries, namely, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Syria. Findings: The single and cross-case analysis found that internally displaced individuals deploy bricolage strategy, for example, reconfiguration of pre-existing resources and competencies (both internal and external), to start up a social venture in the war and conflict zones. They utilise pre-existing internal resources, mainly human capital, and external resources, through a frugal approach towards resources acquisitions. The authors also found that the displaced social entrepreneurs utilise resources of other displaced individuals, for example, networks, volunteers, local knowledge and financial supports mainly from older arrivals, and develop their own enterprise ecosystem within the host location to co-create and co-develop social enterprise and social values for all of them. Research limitations/implications: The findings show that internally displaced individuals utilise bricolage strategies to create and develop socially entrepreneurial venture to serve other internally displaced individuals in the war and conflict zones. As the findings are based on three case studies, for confirmatory approach, a quantitative study with a large sample size is necessary. Furthermore, as the differences in economic, cultural and linguistic in between the home and host locations can have impact on the creation and the development of a social venture, they should be considered in the future studies. Originality/value: This study contributes to the limited literature and studies on social entrepreneurship, specifically, to the context of unstable penurious environment. It also contributes to the literature on bricolage by extending its application from penurious stable environment to the penurious unstable environment. By exploring what and how internal and external resources are utilised to create and develop a socially entrepreneurial venture in a war and conflict zones, this study has added value to the literature on not only bricolage but also entrepreneurship in war and conflict zones. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={In today’s world of wealth centered and technology drivenhuman population, the dawning era of social entrepreneurship acts as an inception agent in finding solutions to nearly all the pivotal and despairing social, environmental and cultural problems prevailing in the society. Throughout history researches carried out on identifying the underlying factors motivating and supporting the evolution and sustainability of social entrepreneurship venture creation, has led to various constructive results. In an attempt to understand the triggering effect these social and entrepreneurial drive factors possess upon an individual’s social entrepreneurship intentions; it was observed that the paradoxical effect of the coexistence of the social and entrepreneurial drive factors on the sustainability of social entrepreneurship has received less attention. Seeking to scrutinize that gap in the literature, this paper aims at identifying the level of inclination social entrepreneurs exhibit towards the social and entrepreneurial drive factors in the process of social entrepreneurship venture creation and the degree of contribution these factors have towards the sustainability of those social ventures from in-person, structured interviews with social entrepreneurs across various fields of operations in Tamil Nadu. This paper follows multivariate analysis techniques for testing the interdependency association amongst the measurement variables measured under entrepreneurial and social drive elements influencing social entrepreneurship. The empirical findings of the paper show that, the entrepreneurial drive factors receive relatively less importance in comparison to the social interests of the entrepreneur. Thus this paper concludes that paradoxical effect between the social and entrepreneurial drive factors have a negative impact on the sustainability of the social enterprises. The paper discussion traces on ways to offset that negative impact and improve sustainability of social enterprises. © BEIESP.},

abstract={Information is an essential input to the entrepreneurial process. Information based on the trials of past entrepreneurial projects can be particularly useful as it reveals details about the local market, benefiting subsequent ventures. Through a formal model of entrepreneurial search characterized by information flows and networks, we hypothesize a diminishing returns relationship between entrepreneurial information, in the form of births and deaths of entrepreneurial projects and economic benefits in the form of employment growth. We leverage the natural experiment contexts of regional economies to explore the role of information as it varies across market scale. In addition, given that networks, an important channel for information, are most powerful and effective in localized settings, we use the regional socio-demographic variation to explore the role of networks defined by gender. We indeed find statistically and economically significant evidence for the information-growth relationship in terms of both market scale and gender, with larger positive employment effects in less dynamic markets and less-networked market contexts. After building the empirical case for the importance of information flows and networks, we conclude with policy implications with particular attention to broadening and deepening entrepreneurial ecosystems. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Although sector choice theory is improving, we have less understanding of how social entrepreneurs view their sector choices in hindsight, particularly given the various barriers to changing organizational form once a legal entity has been established. This article finds that one in six organizational founders in the fair trade industry regrets their initial sector choice. In addition to defining and examining the prevalence of sector regret, this article also identifies three factors that correlate with the sector preferences of fair trade entrepreneurs postestablishment: general funding and support, the availability of grants, and salary. In other words, money, money, and money. As presaged by Dennis Young in 1983, financial flexibility appears to be a key factor in sector fit. Using semistructured interviews (n = 46) and a survey (n = 117), this article examines sector regret and what it tells us about the real differences between the sectors. © The Author(s) 2019.},

abstract={Learning outcomes: The learning objectives of this case are as follows: identify and understand the major challenges/problems faced by a social enterprise in promoting handicraft business; examine the value chain architecture of handicraft products; assess the role of the protagonist (Sanjay) as a social change agent in shaping a successful social enterprise; assess Sahaj Crafts' initiatives and analyze whether the key intervention/s planned/executed were required for skilling up of rural artisans and upgradation of handicraft business; know the marketing strategies for handicraft products; and understand the “strategies” which need to be applied for uplifting people's lives at the bottom of pyramid in general and for enlivening of artisans’ clusters in particular. The outcomes are as follows: examining the value chain architecture of handicraft product; understanding the difficulties and challenges of structuring a viable social business model; examining the role of Sanjay as a social change agent in shaping a successful social enterprise; and examining the model of Craft Incubation Center and design education proposed by Sahaj Crafts for improving rural artisans’ livelihood and skills upgradation. Case overview/synopsis: Sanjay Joshi – the promoter and CEO of “Sahaj Crafts” (a social enterprise established in Western Rajasthan, India), an initiative to strengthen indigenous skills and mainstream rural craft products and artworks – is faced with the question of how to scale up his organization’s operations. Doing so requires that he address these fundamental challenges in terms of – how to deal with unorganized craft communities; match up product orientation to market demands; integrate modern technology / processes in craft business; combat restricted mobility of women artisans; and make effective interventions so that the artisans learn and enjoy working in the current model and solve the financial issues faced by the social enterprise. Providing effective and implementable answers to those questions is vital to Sahaj Craft’s development in attaining its mission to alleviate poverty in the region. Failing to expand operations above a critical scale may leave Sahaj Crafts vulnerable in meeting sufficient demand for contemporary craft products in the mainstream markets. Complexity academic level: This case study is primarily suitable for post-graduate level management students to teach the concepts of designing and operationalizing a “social” business model in a social entrepreneurship module. This case study can also be used for highlighting business model innovations in the social sector of emerging markets. The case could be taught in the following academic domains: social entrepreneurship; bottom of the pyramid; social inclusion; supply chain consolidation (vertical integration in a value chain); marketing strategies for handicraft products; branding; brand positioning; cost and management accounting.

A historical analysis of the issue in postcolonial Ghana from 1957 to 2010 led to the identification of three distinctive phases. The first phase represented the immediate post-colonial reforms (1957-66), where large-scale nationalization and establishment of state-owned enterprises hampered development of private enterprises. The second phase was the turbulent period (1967-79), where totalitarianism and confiscation of assets deterred private investments and ownership, thereby creating a harsh economic and institutional environment. These culminated in the last phase, the renaissance of social entrepreneurship (1980-2010) where different entrepreneurial models flourished, including the diaspora philanthropy and the 'philanthropic chief'. © 2018 The Author(s).},

The explicit research objective is to explain which requirements enable to scale social ventures internationally with success. Research Design & Methods: The study employs a multiple case study analysis based on systematic literature review used to identify papers examining international social enterprises. In total six cases were analysed using the criteria of organisational capabilities included in the SCALERS model. Findings: The analysis showed that the most significant for scaling social enterprises internationally are: Earnings generation and alliance building; next staffing, communicating, and replicating. Less significant are lobbying and stimulating market forces. Implications & Recommendations: The existence of a strong business model, neutral from market sources, well-resourced, recognised in the public sphere associated with scaling up. Contribution & Value Added: The article contributes by revealing that capabilities for ISEs scaling are varied in terms of their significance. The presented results go along with the observation that prior to scaling social impact the basic operational model must show its viability. © 2019, Cracow University of Economics.

abstract={This chapter aims to show how social entrepreneurship contributes to solving persistent and complex problems in various parts of the world, in developed and developing countries, and, this way, how it contributes to sustainable development. By the theory review, research has focused on the activity of social enterprises. Considering the impact that social entrepreneurship has in the communities, there appears to be a clear surplus between results and resources used, both material and human, with a substantial incidence of volunteering. From the results of our study, including the examples of social enterprises presented, it is possible to imagine how empowering communities can contribute to a more sustainable future. Social entrepreneurship is still recent regarding its academic study, and several authors such as Roberts and Woods (Europe 7:45–51, 2000) or Parente et al. (Empreendedorismo social: Contributos teóricos para a sua definição, 2011) refer the scarcity and some confusion still existing in the literature. This work can help improve this picture.

In-depth one-to-one interviews with 12 young entrepreneurs were carried out to collect the data. Four themes and ten sub-themes emerged from the interviews, including early life experience (childhood experience and family experience), inspiration from clients and colleagues (interactions with the target group and exposure to social entrepreneurs), work-related experience (volunteer experience and job-related experience), and personal meaning (contribute back to society, desire for more meaning in life, and personal passions). The implications for policy-makers and interested parties are outlined in regard to enhancing participation and interest among youth for social entrepreneurship. © 2019 Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Focusing on student migration from Bulgaria to Germany, this article examines what types of social capital are accumulated, transformed and implemented through migration, who profits from the investment, and how. The empirical work consists of 60 narrative biographical interviews with migrants and returnees to Bulgaria. The research reveals that the accumulation and investment of social capital takes place throughout the migratory trajectory—starting well before leaving—and is embedded in a transnational social space. Transnational networks exist as family, peer and professional networks, and all of them have a specific meaning for the migrants. Family networks are naturally present; they provide bonding social capital and thus have a stabilizing function for the individual’s identity. Professional networks have a strongly bridging function, helping the young migrants to manage status transitions. After return the transnational social capital acquired during the migratory stay helps returnees to re-integrate and find their way into the Bulgarian labour market. It also encourages them to pursue activities which are meaningful for civil society development, or for innovative (social) entrepreneurship. Thus, transnational social capital helps migrants to align their biographical development to the future, considering the post-transformative environment of Bulgaria, thereby helping to manage transformative changes and supporting societal modernization processes. © 2019, Cogitatio Press.

abstract={In Europe 160 million people are members of social economy enterprises and mutual societies. Members that work at social enterprises usually are bound with an employee relationship with their organization; on the other hand participating in a social enterprise could be their only chance to find a job, especially for economies that face a long-term recession such as the Greek economy. Social enterprises and entrepreneurs invest in reciprocity which represents that positive actions will inspire reciprocal positive actions. The main objective of this study is to examine the effect of reciprocity on members' decision either to invest in social enterprises or to work for them acquiring in both cases the necessary shares. For this reason, a survey was conducted among Greek members of social enterprises listed in the Greek Social enterprises directory, to investigate their aspects about reciprocity and if these aspects affect their decision to work in a social enterprise or support financially them. The survey process returned 142 fully completed questionnaires. The analysis identified a sub group (5 over 27 items) of the questions used to measure reciprocity that can be used to classify participants into shareholders - members (investors) and shareholders - workers in social enterprises. It is worth mentioning that sex or other demographic characteristics of the respondents do not affect this classification while there are only aspects of positive reciprocity that have either positive or negative effect on the possibility to work in social enterprises. Social entrepreneurs and the Greek state could use these findings in order to direct and manage their expansion efforts. © 2019 Universidad Complutense de Madrid. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This paper presents the experience of three women-led cooperatives in Andalusia (Spain) to exemplify a southern European context where high unemployment and austerity measures have increased the importance of social enterprises. These cooperatives developed in the aftermath of the 2008 economic crisis, in a context marked by emerging social needs, coupled with budgetary cuts and changes in social policies that affected southern European countries in particular. The founders of these women-led cooperatives came together attracted by an entrepreneurial model that placed people before capital in the pursuit of social goals, coupled with the economic objective of securing the livelihoods of its members. Discussing Kabeer's empowerment concept, the paper explores how in the Andalusian context the cooperative model is enabling women to improve their overall living conditions, by creating employment that is better suited to their needs, improving their self-esteem and enhancing their sense of empowerment while providing the necessary conditions for greater flexibility and better work-life balance. Nevertheless, in a context marked by the relative absence of alternative opportunities, women's quest for flexibility and their focus on their social mission as opposed to profit-making, also suggests that the risk of perpetuating certain traditional gender roles remains. © 2019 Universidad Complutense de Madrid.

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to shift the idea of competitive strategy from the for-profit to the non-profit context and to explain how social enterprises (SEs) get advantages over competitors within and outside the social sector. Design/methodology/approach: Based upon a sample of 63 SEs located in Greece, the exploratory research employs factor analysis to answer which strategic options they have to compete. Subsequent analysis of variance and correlation analysis were performed to answer if competitive strategic options relate to impact SEs generate. Findings: The empirical findings identify and empirically validate a variety of strategic options based on four pure (low cost, low cost sustainability, low cost focus and differentiation focus) and one hybrid (efficient differentiation) types of competitive advantage. Additional evidence shows that hybrid compared to pure strategic options link more influentially to impact in terms of positive environmental, social and economic contributions. Research limitations/implications: Apart from providing some explanations of how mission-driven businesses compete, it helps widening the debate of pure vs hybrid strategies beyond the commercial sector. Contrary to what the authors already know, the evidence presented here shows that strategic purity and hybridization co-exist in the social sector. Originality/value: This is the first study with empirical evidence on competitive strategies from businesses in the third sector emphasizing how SEs ensure competitive advantage along with impact potential. Consequently, the authors respond to recent calls for more survey-based, quantitative evidence in the social entrepreneurship field. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Social entrepreneurship (SE) strategic literature is in an under-theorized condition for large-scale strategy setting and classification. However, the research intends to fill the gap by proposing a literature-supported governmental-scale SE strategic grid. Thus, a systematic SE literature review was conducted up to getting four core strategic orientations of Externalism vs. Internalism, and Governmentalism vs. Volunteerism. Accompanied with a study of large-scale SE strategic partnerships by local, global, national and international social enterprises, four patterns of partnership (hence, dimensionality) within Localism vs. Globalism, and Nationalism vs. Internationalism were emerged. Later, the orientations and dimensions were corroborated based on the officially released documents of 15 governments, selected randomly in three economic classes, based on the recent UN’s triad economic classification. Next, four comprehensive SE strategic classifications of Global Citizen Strategy, Opened Door Strategy, Closed Door Strategy, and Country Citizen Strategy were recognized. Finally, combining the classified strategies with their orientations and dimensions on a visualized framework led to an ultimate comprehensive SE strategic grid. The implications of the grid are its potential consensus making effect not only among SE strategists on the governmental scale but also in the academic settings. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Research that does regard the impact of state power is almost exclusively anchored in and geared toward neoliberal policy contexts. This article examines the dialectics between state power and entrepreneurial counterpower in the institutional context of the Netherlands. Moreover, since social entrepreneurs develop different tactics and strategies for responding to challenges, we use Gaventa’s power cube to distinguish forms of power and counterpower, which we then combine with the following inductively derived social entrepreneur typologies: successful hybrids, antagonistic organizers, and autonomous entrepreneurs. This offers insights into the development of theory in relation to the social entrepreneurial potential for change and civic participation. © 2019, The Author(s).},

Based on a review of 641 academic journal abstracts, it is apparent that social enterprises are emerging as a dominant organizational entity for addressing persistent social, economic, and environmental challenges in many different countries. Key themes for curriculum development relate to content associated with the political-economic environment for which social enterprises have emerged, business and marketing strategies, internal organizational dynamics (such as leadership strategies), along with an assessment of the general possible impact that social enterprises can have on vulnerable social groups. Advancement of curriculum related to social enterprises—with emphasis on business development and leadership—is an important and necessary component to effectively prepare social work students for contemporary social work practice and leadership. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

The purpose of this study is to investigate several macro-level factors that can stimulate or impede the emergence of social entrepreneurship. Although little prior research on how these determinants impact social entrepreneurship has been conducted, this study reveals that several crucial macro-level variables appear to be related to social entrepreneurship. Unlike previous studies, this study employs enhanced variables designed to capture local perceptions as well as secondary data inputs. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression techniques were used to understand their effects on social entrepreneurial activity. The results reveal that a country’s governance and female migration are related to the level of social entrepreneurial activity. In addition, positive female migration serves as an important mediating role between governance and increased levels of social entrepreneurial activity. Moreover, implications for understanding the role of macro-level factors on social entrepreneurship as well as the study’s limitations are discussed. © The Author(s) 2017.},

To solve this problem, first, for a sustainable social enterprise, entrepreneurial spirit should be premised not only on the establishment of clear mission and vision of social entrepreneur. Second, creating a friendly market for social enterprises, as well as effective public relations, such as cost reduction and joint marketing of social enterprises, is necessary. Third, there is a platform to establish a close collaboration between social enterprise-related parties, and it is necessary to elaborate a strategy that can coexist with local and social enterprises. Finally, local governments are expected to contribute to the development of social enterprises by organically linking the forms of middle organizations, such as the Jeju social economic network. © Rushing Water Publishers Ltd. 2018.},

These projects endeavour for social integration of young persons into education programmes and adult persons into work. Through these empirical cases, this article aims to conceive how place conditions the capacities and practices of social entrepreneurship. The place-based approach of the discussion shows how the interplay of local and multiscalar relations impacts social entrepreneurship initiatives. The analysis of the empirical cases involves considering the role of the local context as well as the institutional systems of the welfare states and wider policy regimes endorsing social investment strategies. The discussion employs a model for organisational arrangements focusing on capacities of learning, exploiting, and linking. The capacity of linking across organisations and sector boundaries is found to be a particularly intriguing aspect of the investigated social entrepreneurship initiatives and is something that the place-based approach of the article is able to explicate. © 2018, The Author(s) 2018.},

abstract={British colonial military heritage structures in Hong Kong are in a state of ruin and government neglect. Urgent attention is required in the form of active management to avoid the loss of valuable heritage resources and the negative impact on the landscape and environment. This paper explores two possible alternatives–user participation and social entrepreneur participation–to achieve innovative solutions to rent dissipation of these structures situated in isolated areas within protected-area boundaries, with a focus on a specific case. Emphasis is placed on fostering public participation, involving the allocation of some property rights. Elinor Ostrom's diagnostic approach to common-pool resource problems is applied to both solutions to determine the conditions necessary to achieve the objectives. The discussions are informed by social entrepreneurship principles and a version of the Coase Theorem, the latter coinciding with Ostrom's view regarding the role of property rights in achieving sustainable outcomes. © 2017 Newcastle University.},

abstract={Since the Korean government enacted the Social Enterprise Promotion Act of 2007 aiming to foster and support social enterprises, discourse on the social economy has proliferated both quantitatively and qualitatively. One explanation for this phenomenon is that government-driven policies have dominantly led social enterprises to the ecology of the social economy. To cope with pernicious issues such as unemployment, growing demand for welfare, and the widening gap between rich and poor, however, it cannot be discounted that social activists and nonprofits also have facilitated the development of social enterprises by building online and offline networks. To fill this niche of applying these concepts to the Asian context, this research aims to investigate the ecology of the social economy by analyzing critical stakeholders and keywords embedded in self-organizing networks on social media. This case is critical and attractive to researchers and practitioners not only because the discourse on social economy has not been fully examined but also because self-organizing networks on social media act as social capital among stakeholders and thus offer valuable insights into dealing with the enduring problems that government-driven policies seem unsolvable. By analyzing the evolution of self-organizing social economy networks and social entrepreneurs on Facebook, this research provides policy implications for other Asian countries with underdeveloped social economies and theoretically contributes to the field of public policy analysis and management. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Purpose: Insights into the roots of social enterprise from before the term was adopted are provided by examining histories of charitable service and comparing current understandings of social enterprise. Social enterprise models of welfare provision are evidenced from the seventeenth century onwards. Persistent themes are identified that provide insights for current practice and understanding. Design/methodology/approach: This historiography examines interpretations from 1905 to the present day of examples of welfare provision between two watershed points: 1600, just prior to the Poor Laws and 1908, when the Old Age Pensions Act shifted emphasis in public sector provision. Findings: Activities that would nowadays be termed social enterprise are evidenced in histories of charitable philanthropy covering each century since 1600. Prevailing attitudes uncritically demarcated deserving and undeserving poor. Histories contributed to a heroic narrative of social entrepreneurs, describing activities dependent on well-networked, politically active individuals that rarely continued beyond their involvement. The political environment was recognised to influence the types of organisations, governance and resourcing. Research limitations/implications: The historiography takes examples from three centuries between 1600 and1908 but is not comprehensive. Recurrent themes are identified for further research. Originality/value: Social enterprise is a twenty-first-century label but not a new phenomenon. Identification of prevailing themes provides insights for the understanding of social enterprises in the twenty-first century. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The chapter presents the role played by European Union social enterprises in creating innovation, driving growth and reducing unemployment and poverty. It starts with refining the meanings of social enterprise to have a consistent definition which can be broadly used across all European countries. It further introduces the forms of organization of social enterprises and common fields where they operate together with associated target groups. Furthermore, a financial model for the social enterprise is introduced. The next part of the chapter discusses the ways in which social enterprises can contribute to the economy and what networks and mutual support mechanisms there are for social enterprises at European level. The chapter also brings into the discussion real case examples of social enterprises and their key success factors. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.},

abstract={Despite its long history, social entrepreneurship research and education are not old topics in Iran. In fact, the history mainly goes back to the establishment of the Faculty of Entrepreneurship in the University of Tehran. On the one hand, more generally, the roadmap of research on social entrepreneurship still remains controversial, and fragmented efforts are made and continued to investigate this topic in Iran. On the other hand, social entrepreneurship education was mostly developed based on the topics covered by the curriculum which was designed by the faculty members of the Faculty of Entrepreneurship. Incremental improvements, however, are considered. Thus, the present chapter tried to shed light on social entrepreneurship research and education in Iran. To do so, the main Persian databases for papers (Magiran, SID, and Noormags) and theses (IranDoc, and the Library of the University of Tehran) were selected and searched accordingly. In addition to this, research works indexed in Google scholar, Thomson Reuters and Scopus databases were added. Then, the research works were categorized based on their publication date. Finally, the trend and a classified view of the status quo were presented. Secondly, in order to elaborate on the status of social entrepreneurship education in the country, the evidence from those research works was added to the national reports, and thus an integrated view was offered. In conclusion, the chapter concluded with some remarks on the improvement of the research roadmap and education on social entrepreneurship in Iran, as well as some directions for future research. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.},

A quantitative approach was used with 390 active Enactus participants in Malaysia. The entire sample reported that the tested variables had positive relationships with SE intention. Practical implication of this study would benefit the Ministry of Education and Enactus Foundation especially in formulating SE education programs for higher education institutions and increasing the number of community heroes who will help solving socio-economic problems.

The text argues that one of the tools of social inclusion – social economy represented by social entrepreneurship and social farming – is a sort of innovative practice. The findings suggest that the understanding of social inclusion evolves within policy documents towards highlighting social economy through matching its theoretical concept with political measures. However, social economy is still not considered by the documents as an innovative approach. If analysing projects funded under Czech Rural Development Programs, social inclusion in rural areas is not the main theme, especially in regions exposed to the risk of social exclusion. In addition, the main actors (NGOs or social entrepreneurs) who are said to support social economy or social farming are not active in submitting projects in rural areas under the Rural Development Program 2007–2013. These actors have not yet used their potential towards developing social economy. © 2018, Czech Academy of Agricultural Sciences. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Recently in Italy, new enhancement forms of real-estate property based on grass-roots participation came to light. The development of these initiatives enabled bottom-up valorization to become a viable alternative to the current forms of reuse of the public assets promoted by the public authorities. On closer look, some experiences are more successful than others that fail in a short time. This seems to depend on the presence of the social entrepreneur, a specific actor able to efficiently coordinate and manage the bottom-up, value-creation process. The aim of this paper is to investigate the role of the social entrepreneur and the way in which he/she promotes the public real-estate properties’ enhancement through grass-roots participation. Comparing two emblematic case studies in Italy, distinguished by the presence-absence of the social entrepreneur, the paper points out the role and the importance of this actor, a catalyst able to seize the economic and the social opportunities gathering around the initiative; to design an overall business strategy; and to involve the citizenry to strengthen these bottom-up initiatives. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.},

The objective was to examine the pre-conditions for the birth and growth of university-based ventures in Thailand, where science commercialisation has not yet flourished. Design/methodology/approach: A single case study approach was adopted for the in-depth study of the birth of an unusual entrepreneurial initiative in one academic unit within a dental school, an environment that typically focuses on academic work. Data from interviews with key members working in this unit were analysed to reveal the pre-conditions of entrepreneurship within this Thai university department, with a focus on the existing understanding of academic entrepreneurship. Findings: Social conditions, rather than technology-related motives, were important for the birth of the university-based venture examined. Key triggers for academic entrepreneurship in this situation were found to closely align with a model of social entrepreneurship. Originality/value: Evidence from this emerging economy can help expand the typology of academic entrepreneurship. In addition to the technology-led ventures typically seen, the results from this study call for socially oriented university-based ventures that tackle social problems in local society. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Theoretically, according to the Franco-Austrian-Norwegian (FAN) scientific tradition, innovation is defined as a new combination of the first and second input factors in a production function. The result of successful business and social entrepreneurship is economic development, equal rights, a better world, peace, freedom, a more secure society for everyone, as well as technological, economic and social progress. These are all parameters that define the modern Western style democracy, and even more, these prerequisites represent the conditions for the maintenance, construction and dissemination of democracy to new territories throughout the world. Successful entrepreneurs are private individuals whose role can never be substituted by any group of members, be it political parties, governments, boards of directors, committees or power based authorities like the political boss. Throughout history, we have seen national states, big and small, trying to overrule the wisdom of science and that they have failed.

Such reflection builds upon two experimentations developed in Italy: the first one aimed at investigating new strategies to enhance the distinctive collaborative role of social enterprises, the second one was devoted to rethinking the existing services of cooperatives by including users in the co-design and co-production phases. Benefiting from the lessons learnt from these two case studies, this paper attempts to shape the notion of ‘design for social enterprises’ as a field in which a combination of design methods and tools may support a cultural and organisational change that places collaboration with communities of users and other local actors at the centre of the social entrepreneurial process. © 2017 The Author(s).

abstract={In this article, we explore the dimensions involved in creating a sustainability-focused entrepreneurial venture within a community. In these ventures the entrepreneur may be the central hub of venture activities, but the interdependence between the entrepreneur and partners in the community is critical. Our observations suggest that the path toward sustainability starts with external collaboration with entities in the entrepreneur's surrounding system. Our aim is to extend entrepreneurship research through an examination of sustainability, which calls for a recalibration in the role of profit and social/economic good. This research offers a comparative analysis of two case studies, and proposes a fluid and integrative multi-systems model of collaboration with various entities, including governments, the private sector, non-government organizations (NGOs), and the larger community. © 2017, © 2017 Journal of the Canadian Council for Small Business and Entrepreneurship/Conseil de la PME et de l'entrepreneuriat.},

abstract={World Vision exists to eradicate extreme poverty. The primary fundraising mechanism that has fuelled its growth into one of the largest international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) has been Child Sponsorship, which connects over 10 million individual donors with vulnerable children around the world. However, shifts in the market, geopolitical landscape, and institutional logics have seen this once innovative product come under increasing pressure. Using World Vision New Zealand (WVNZ) as a case study, we explore the challenges of implementing social entrepreneurship strategies, including the institutional constraints of developing new business models, through hybridization. Hybridity has gained increasing attention in the field of entrepreneurship and has been offered as a sensemaking frame for business model innovation within social entrepreneurship. The use of institutional logics to understand the challenges of hybrid organizing in social entrepreneurship has been invaluable. However, as with any theoretical perspective, this approach has limitations. We suggest that nuanced challenges and sources of resistance to social entrepreneurship in established sectors and organizations might usefully be explored through concepts drawn from complexity theory. Specifically, we propose the use of the concept of structural attractors, which enables the explication of convergent, unifying, and generative dynamics. Our case study findings suggest that, paradoxically, the very essence of historical success may constrain future success. To wit, when faced with changes to institutional and market conditions, WVNZ was constrained by the very construct that enabled its initial growth. The challenge that this case demonstrates is that despite ostensibly hybrid shifts occurring in the management, governance, and espoused innovation strategy of the organization, the governing structural attractor of Child Sponsorship has constrained innovation and change. © Copyright 2018 by Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={We contribute to the growing literature examining how social enterprises might best accommodate their hybrid structure when pursuing dual goals of social improvement and economic sustainability. Drawing on extant literature, the case is made for why synergy between the social and commercial business models that hybrid social enterprises employ should positively impact effectiveness in delivering organization outcomes. We then develop a method for comparing the synergy between the social and commercial business models employed within and across organizations, and test the method using a sample of seven social enterprises operating in different social fields. Results demonstrate that our method can be applied consistently across a range of social enterprise types and that variation in degree of synergy is considerable with overlap rates ranging from 9% to 77%. Using learning from this exploratory study, we develop propositions describing how and why social entrepreneurs develop business model synergy, the relationship between business model synergy and organizational performance, and suggest future research to test these propositions. Implications for theory development and practice are discussed. © Copyright 2018 by Emerald Publishing Limited.},

It achieves this objective through investigating the influence of social ventures' entry, exit and density on the entry rate of commercial ventures. Design/methodology/approach - Organizational ecology is applied for theoretical analysis and the feasible generalized least square method for empirical analysis. Findings - The study, in overall, finds a diffuse competition between the populations of social and commercial ventures. The results have revealed a negative influence of social ventures' entry and density on the entry rate of commercial ventures and a positive influence of the social ventures' exit on commercial ventures' entry rate in a region. Originality/value - The study is one of the few in its filed that empirically studies the interaction between social and commercial ventures and the first study, which investigates it in the context of Sweden. The previous two studies, however, have only examined either the influence of social ventures entry or social venture density on the entry rate of commercial ventures. This study, however, examines the influence of both of those factors plus the influence of social venture exit on commercial venture entry. The study is also unique regarding the large-scale database it uses including all the 290 municipalities all over Sweden 1990-2014. © 2017 Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The topic of social entrepreneurship is currently often discussed and it is one of the trends of contemporary social economy in the CR. The Czech Republic is one of the countries that start discovering the benefits of social business, especially at the regional level. Experience from abroad clearly identifies the positive impacts of social entrepreneurship on the national economy. Social enterprises are one of the major stakeholders in the labour market employing socially disadvantaged people. This paper aims to identify the main barriers to the activities of social enterprises. To identify those barriers, use was made of a questionnaire survey in social businesses. Based on the results of the survey it was identified that the current main barriers include the non-existence of the social entrepreneurship act, insufficient definition of criteria for social enterprises and inadequate inter-departmental coordination. Potential future challenges appear to be legislative and systematic state financial support and preparation of the environment for social activities within the framework of regional cooperation including the establishment of social incubators.},

In EMs, there is an untapped market called bottom of the pyramid, which is the largest and the fastest growing segment in the entire world. There is a big scope for MNCs to achieve success in EMs by focusing on innovation at BOP. The main objective of this paper is to identify and understand innovation dimensions that lead to social value creation in a BOP market. To achieve the above mentioned objective, the case studies from published literature were selected. We also draw on emerging research on BOP from the innovation and social entrepreneurship fields as well as from social value creation. The literature on marketing to the bottom of the pyramid was extensively reviewed and dimensions of innovation and social value creation at BOP were identified. Authors established relationships between these identified dimensions of innovation and social value creation in the form of research propositions. Finally, a model depicting relationships between above mentioned variables has been proposed. At the end, we have discussed some important implications for both theory and practice. © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={Purpose - Occupational therapists are increasingly working in organisations outside of the public sector. UK government policy over the past decade has promoted health and social care provision by social enterprises. The purpose of this paper is to examine the compatibility of occupational therapy practice and a social enterprise environment, within the UK and questions if this approach may enhance experiences of social inclusion for people who use these services. Design/methodology/approach - Case study methodology was used with eight social enterprises in the UK. Data were collected through: semi-structured interviews, formal organisational documents, and field visits and observations. Interviews were conducted with 26 participants who were occupational therapists, service users and social entrepreneurs/managers. The interviews were recorded, transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis. Findings - Occupational therapists experienced job satisfaction, professional autonomy and were able to practise according to their professional philosophy. Service users valued support with: employment, routine, social relationships, and developing a sense of identity, particularly outside of a medical model definition. To a degree therefore, people using these services claimed socially inclusive benefits. Challenges with funding social enterprises, however, impacted occupational therapy delivery in some cases. Research limitations/implications - The majority of social enterprise research is drawn from case study methodology; however, this was the most appropriate research design to gain greatest insight into a small but developing phenomenon. Further research into occupational therapy practice within social enterprises is required, particularly on the effectiveness of returning to work and social inclusion. Social implications - Social enterprises can provide therapeutic environments to promote recovery and social inclusion which is also compatible with occupational therapy practice. Originality/value - This is the first known national research into occupational therapy provision in social enterprises within the UK, which evidences a compatibility within occupational therapy practice within a social enterprise environment and the benefits of this. © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Crowd-funding is used by business and social entrepreneurs to fund projects that impact society in many ways. Although crowd-funders fund and support entrepreneurial projects, stakeholders are less aware of crowd-funder motivations and behaviours towards products/services, which impact on the success of these projects. The purpose of this research, therefore, is two-fold: a) development of crowd-funder value framework for understanding crowd-funder motivations; and b) provision of robust theoretical basis to the construct of 'crowd-funding'. Different social constructs, such as social identity, and symbolic, crowd and relational social capital related to crowd-funding are discussed based on symbolic convergence theory of communication and social identity theory. This framework will act as a roadmap to understand how crowd-funder motivations impact and create value for individuals, organisations and society, and inform how social, environmental and economic value and impact can be maximised through crowd-funding initiatives. © 2017 by IGI Global.

Yet, foundations face increased competition in terms of influence and support. In many countries, the giving options for individual donors have exploded; donors can give to a proliferating array of causes and organizations and create vehicles for giving, such as donor advised funds (DAFs) in the US, that depart from the traditional foundation model. The widespread interest in social entrepreneurship, social innovation, and social enterprise has tended to focus attention on programmatic outcomes and leveraging grant funds. Many foundations also experienced steep losses in their assets due to the financial crisis, leading them to be more attentive than ever to the allocation of their scarce grant monies. With increased competition to their influence and legitimacy, many foundations are innovating in their structure, investment strategies, giving patterns, and creating new alliances and partnerships (Salamon, 2014). © 2015 selection and editorial material, Steven Rathgeb Smith.},

abstract={Social Entrepreneurship education is in its infancy, especially compared with more general Entrepreneurship education, so it is not at all surprising that there is very little research into this area. Indeed, as far as we are aware there is very little practice of specifically tailoring social entrepreneurship education for scientists and engineers. This latter observation is, however, surprising, as some have suggested that a significant proportion of social entrepreneurs are scientists and engineers seeking to turn their skills to solve social problems. In addition, the funding and evaluation of scientific research increasingly requires discussion of social impact, a topic central to contemporary social entrepreneurship. Following a preliminary discussion of the recent emergence of "tech for good", we explore two central issues to be addressed in educating scientists and engineers about the complex world of social entrepreneurship: the long tradition of social responsibility amongst scientists and engineers, and different approaches to the analysis of innovation. Although the popular image of scientists and engineers is that they are disinterested neutral observers there is a long tradition of scientists and engineers becoming embroiled in the role of science and technology within contemporary society. J.D. Bernal famously aroused the wrath of Karl Popper in the 1930s with his calls for greater political oversight of scientific research, and in the late 1960s the British Society for Social Responsibility in Science engaged in controversies such as university engagement in research into chemical weapons. Social responsibility, we would argue, has long been a distinctive characteristic of many, even most scientists and engineers. Teaching them about social entrepreneurship and social enterprise will need to understand, work with and develop this tendency. The concept of social innovation, dating back to the 1990s, broadly describes developing new solutions to social problems. Scientists and engineers are of course familiar with the processes of technological innovation so again we have a very good potential fit between scientists, engineers and social entrepreneurship. However, many of the most effective approaches to the socio-economic analysis of innovation are based on some form of social constructionist perspective and hence potentially clash with scientists' and engineers' training. This is our second key issue. These preliminary thoughts will be illustrated through discussion of the current education about social entrepreneurship with a UK-based scientist/engineer working with a project centred on a bio-waste energy plant in India. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

abstract={The definition of entrepreneurship usually leads us through business and profit-maximizing techniques and attitudes, usually characterizing individuals and company makers. Recently, the use of the term social entrepreneurship has also been gaining popularity, to describe the entrepreneurial activities with the goal of creating social value (Abu-Saifan, Technol Innov Manag Rev: 22–27, 2012; Shane and Venkataraman, Acad Manag Rev 25: 217–226, 2000). Entrepreneurial activity, in its broad definition, is associated to several factors, both external, such as the economy, employability, market opportunities, and internal, such as the personality characteristics of individuals (Zhao, Seibert, and Lumpkin 2010). In fact, specific traits, such as leadership, optimism, perseverance, passion, resilience, creativity, empathy and others, are more easily found in entrepreneurial individuals. Although not usually considered as explicit competences in the curriculum of higher education degrees, these personality traits can be strengthened, and skills can be learned either directly or by specifying horizontal competences in higher education programmes. The training intentionality of higher education institutions is described in the curricular unit forms, which constitute the study plan of current educational programmes. These are rigorously focused on vertical competences, associated to the scientific area of the programme, but they also include horizontal skills, that contribute to empower the student with a broader set of knowledge and abilities. The teaching and learning methodologies, the content of the curricular units and the learning outcomes all describe the training process, which can be analysed to get an overall idea of the intentionality of entrepreneurship training in current educational degrees. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract={This chapter explores the concept of ‘social value’ from the perspectives of both social entrepreneurs and the beneficiaries. All social entrepreneurs see ‘social value creation’ in bringing social change or creating social impact, (long term impact)/outcomes, (immediate or short term impact), while addressing social problems/issues/needs. This social change or social impact/outcome includes a wide range of social impacts, starting from creating awareness, empowering beneficiaries, bringing about changes in behaviour, attitude, perception, norms and institutions, to create socio-economic benefits for the beneficiaries and impact their lives at the institutional, individual, community, state, national and in some cases, the international level. Social entrepreneurs create value not only for the poor and marginalised people, but also for the affluent sections of the society. Beneficiaries perceive ‘value’ in getting various kinds of benefits created by social entrepreneurs for them, and in various positive changes and impacts (direct and indirect) in their lives brought in because of these benefits. Chapter 4 provided a brief description of each case included in the study. This chapter would first present an understanding of ‘social value’ from the perspectives of both social entrepreneurs and beneficiaries. © Springer India 2016.},

abstract={Crowdfunding is an increasingly attractive source to fund social projects. However, to our best knowledge, the study of crowdfunding for social purposes has remained largely unexplored in the literature. This research envisages a detailed examination of the role of crowdfunding on the early-stage of the social projects at regional level. By comparing the characteristics of the projects available in the Portuguese Social Stock Exchange platform with others that did not use this source of financial support, we envisage to show the critical role of crowdfunding on regional development. The use of inferential techniques (Chi-square test, the Cramer’s V statistic, the Goodman and Kruskal? and the odds ratio) demonstrates that the use of the Portuguese Social Stock Exchange platform was linked to the geographical location of the social venture as well as its geographical scope. Also, social ventures located on rural regions are more likely to use social crowdfunding platforms than social ventures located in urban areas. Further, the circumstance of having the social ventures acting at a local or regional level seems to be strongly associated with the possibility of using crowdfunding for financing social projects. © 2016, Editura Universitatii din Bucuresti.

abstract={Purpose – This chapter aims to understand how partnerships and networks can aid the development and growth of organizations whose goal is to foster social inclusion along the agro-food supply chain, with particular reference to the social entrepreneurship sector. Methodology/approach – The chapter draws on a framework proposed by Newth and Woods (2014) to identify the main drivers of resistance to the development of social entrepreneurship. The empirical evidence is based on a single case, involving an Italian social enterprise, Semi di Liberta`, which produces high-quality artisan beer. Case material included an analysis of organization documents and interviews with key actors. Findings – The case study shows how Semi di Liberta` faced different types of resistance, related to formal and informal institutions and market drivers, and leveraged partnerships with other actors in the ecosystem. Some of these partnerships were planned a priori to overcome specific problems (e.g., the Prison’s Authority, Mastri Birrai). Other partnerships were developed “by chance” (e.g., “peer” associations) but turned out to be particularly important to deal with the above resistances. Research limitations/implications – The case study methodology prevents the authors from generalizing too far past the obtained results. However, key elements from the case, such as the relevance of “spontaneous” partnerships and those with “peer” organizations, could be taken into account for similar initiatives in different contexts. Originality/value – Recent literature has highlighted the relevance of partnerships in scaling social enterprises but has not explored the dynamics whereby these partnerships are created and developed. This chapter provides some preliminary evidence of how partnerships can be used to overcome the resistance limiting the growth of social entrepreneurship and the sustainability of socially inclusive initiatives. © 2016 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

The study uses the qualitative approach based on cross-sectional data, non-participatory observation, focus group discussions, and semi-structured in-depth interviews. Representatives were taken from three social enterprises engaged in the business of hospitality, herbal products, and organic vegetables. The elements of social capital that emerged had two dimensions: the value-based and knowledge-based dimensions. The value-based dimension consisted of generosity, trust, harmony, industriousness, honesty, perseverance, and forgiveness, while the knowledge-based dimension involved learning ability, the ability to deliver knowledge, local wisdom, and the use of technology. The characteristics and patterns of social capital mobilization that emerged began from the categorization of related communities, the connection building through mediation, dialogue, trust in the social spirit of the communities, and the use of community capacity unto the generation of positive outcomes in those communities. All told, both social enterprises and the communities greatly benefited from the social capital generated. © 2016 by De La Salle University.},

A key contribution of this study is the comprehensive conceptual framework used to analyze the link between social entrepreneurship and international business. The second key contribution is the econometric analysis of SEA's effect on greenfield FDI, foreign employment, and foreign projects.

abstract={The purpose of this chapter is to analyse the institutional factors that condition entrepreneurial activity, distinguishing between social and commercial entrepreneurship and using institutional theory as conceptual framework. We statistically test our hypotheses through linear regression models in a global setting using a sample of 43 countries and data from Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, Doing Business, and Worldwide Governance Indicators (2009). Compared with commercial entrepreneurship we find that social entrepreneurship is positively influenced by education level whereas the minimum capital requirements do not affect the social entrepreneurial process in contrast to commercial entrepreneurship. In addition, the results suggest that role models and fear of failure influence social entrepreneurship. This study contributes theoretically (advancing in the literature with an integrated model that relates institutions and entrepreneurial activity considering the relationship between social and commercial entrepreneurial activity) and practically (for the design of policies to foster both social and commercial entrepreneurship). © 2015, IGI Global.

abstract={Traditionally, the non-profit and charitable sector has fulfilled the role of addressing inadequacies in markets with respect to social needs. While the number of organizations in this sector has increased in recent decades (Austin, Stevenson, & Wei-Skillern 2006), in the face of reduced funding from government, many of these organizations have changed significantly and are attempting to generate large proportions of their revenues through the sale of products and services using for-profit business models. At the same time, for-profit firms with direct social missions – for-profit social ventures – are also emerging (Dees & Anderson 2003). These new breeds of organizations, often termed social enterprises (SEs) utilize for-profit models, compete directly with other organizations to generate revenues and profits, but work equally hard at delivering social value. As such, SEs are dedicated to mitigating or eliminating social problems while deploying innovative change strategies (Bloom 2010). © 2015, Academy of Marketing Science.},

abstract={There is a need to promote social entrepreneurship in order to solve some of the complex problems facing the Caribbean (poverty, unemployment, crime and other serious issues). The situation in some Caribbean countries is dire. For example, with an average gross domestic product of less than $450 per head in 2002, which has not changed in real terms since the 1970s, Haiti remains the poorest country in the western hemisphere (United Nations, 2003). Over 60 per cent of the population lives in extreme poverty and the majority is completely out of reach of any governmental amenities and services (United Nations Development Programme [UNDP], 1999; United Nations, 2000; World Bank, 2001). Using a systems approach, this paper argues that social entrepreneurship can be used as a vehicle to promote national human resource development, which will assist in the alleviation of societal ills on the national level as well as throughout the Caribbean. © 2015, Allied Academies.

abstract={Our objective is to explain critically the possibility of direct participation of researchers and respondents in the development of information technology (IT)-based social entrepreneurship projects at a further education and training (FET) college in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We use concepts of innovative social practice, risk-taking, the motivation of entrepreneurs and the creation of social value (Dees, 2001; Smith, Barr, Barbosa & Kickul, 2008; Trexler, 2008). We use these ideas to inform our methodology of action research and participatory involvement of researchers to locate our work in both theory and practice (Bornstein & Davis, 2010; Kemmis, 2008; Reason & Bradbury, 2008; Stringer, 2007). We use Stringer's (2007) community-based participatory research model which includes three major stages: looking, thinking and acting while observation and reflection are processes that occur in the evolution of each stage. The need to work collaboratively with the participants and to build a network of relationships to improve the economic and social lives of individuals and communities is central to our approach. The data collected in the research were arranged in themes using the sustainable livelihoods framework. Our findings demonstrate how the development of social enterprises can be contextualised to provide a greater understanding of the challenges faced by marginalised communities in terms of developing enterprises and the actions necessary for creating value from this research. Of the two important outcomes, the first was the formation of a cooperative called Xumana-IT by the participants and the researchers. The second outcome involved the development of a model for developing social entrepreneurship at FET colleges. The research outcomes show first how the involvement of non-profit and non-governmental organisations together with for-profit social enterprises in South African regions can be brought together for collaborative effort. Second, we show how FE institutions could become centres of social entrepreneurship in both urban and rural areas to support marginalised communities using a ‘socially-involved’ approach. They could be supported by universities by way of curriculum development for social entrepreneurship since there is nothing currently available. Third, the value of our research is in the demonstration of the value of entrepreneurial activism through research-based activity which enables enquiry and action to combine critically to open up new routes to entrepreneurship research. © 2015 SAGE Publications.},

abstract={In the context of ongoing climate change, the critical factors for the livelihood and environmental sustainability of small farmers are the resilience and the capacity to cope using little technology, which needs to be strengthened to manage climate resilience. This paper uses several methods to examine the vulnerability and livelihood interaction between small farmers, especially how they cope and adapt to climate variability using artificial glacier technology. This case study can be used to draw lessons to support the climate adaptation strategies for small farmers and enhance their resilience to livelihood stresses. The study is based on the primary data and information collected from 675 households in 27 villages of Leh (Ladakh) in north-west Himalaya, India, and reveals that 61.18 % of the population is fully supporting their livelihoods from agriculture and allied activities. With increased irrigation potential due to the use of artificial glaciers, food security has been assured to 77.56 % of the poor smallholder households and health vulnerability has been reduced in 31 % of the households. The seasonal migration has declined in nearly two-thirds of smallholder households as a diversification mechanism, thereby improving their livelihood strategies. The use of tactical adaptations by small farmers in response to the persistent droughts such as the selling of livestock, expanding agricultural lands, and the use of relief cash and food has declined to 20.44, 24.74, and 63 % of smallholder households, respectively. However, these measures are unsustainable in the long term. How should the policy makers and other societal stakeholders act in this context? To address the small farmers’ livelihood challenges in the context of climate change, the role of innovative technology is vital to improve climate adaptations and governance using a multidisciplinary approach involving multilateral collaboration among different stakeholders. The presence of social entrepreneurs (the new actors on the adaptation scene) is necessary to bring forth the necessary measures. To this end, better linking of science and technology policies together with other policies should be encouraged. The social transfers through better health care, access to safe drinking water, better sanitary conditions, and improved standards of education and infrastructure are the win-win measures to enhance the community’s adaptive capacity, which requires significant amounts of additional investment. Besides, developing the institutional mechanisms for specific adaptation interventions can be one of most effective ways of implementing a plan and achieving the expected outcome. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={Technology and innovation play significant role in economic growth. However, for inclusive growth, growth in social sector is critical. Entrepreneurs and social entrepreneurs have experimented a lot to combine technology and innovation to create the desired social change. Though, scholarly literature has considered entrepreneurs as change agents, and also emphasized the importance of innovation for entrepreneurial process, but little attention has been paid to find out the role that technology and innovation play in social change process or to explain the process of deployment of technology or application of innovation in creating social change. Drawing on a variety of literature, personal observations and experiences of the authors, the chapter presents a conceptual framework on the process of creating social change. By theorizing the phenomena, this chapter is a step towards theory building. Incorporating Bandura’s ‘Social Cognitive Theory’ and Davis’ ‘Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)’, the framework also gives due importance to the role of entrepreneurs in fostering social change. It explains two-way relationship between technology and innovation and presents five different ways of combining technology and innovation for creating social change. Finally, it offers a set of propositions and suggests validation with in-depth case studies for further advancement of the theory. © Springer India 2015.},

The data presented in this paper is the result of an external consulting and assessment work, requested and financed by the two projects in analysis, by the use of a multiple and mixed-method research design conducted over three phases and during four years. The results reveal that Portuguese community organizations are far from being a passive partner which merely executes guidelines when in partnership with the State. On the contrary, main findings support the idea that these organizations aim at the promotion of local (social and economic) development and can play an important mediation role between programmatic guidelines and their execution, strongly reflecting their own political identity in both the process and the results. © 2014, Editura Lumen.

abstract={The Kenya Agricultural Commodity Exchange Limited (KACE) was incorporated in 1992 but formally launched in 1997 to address the challenges facing farmers in Kenya, especially poor smallholder farmers, in accessing input and output markets. A commercial for-profit model was chosen in order to charge clients modest fees for services rendered and raise revenue to sustain the services in the long term. The KACE model has evolved through various stages over time, with KACE developing, testing and experimenting with various platforms to link smallholder farmers to more remunerative markets. This article describes the various platforms, the challenges that were experienced and how they were addressed at each stage in the evolution. Chronologically, these platforms consisted of a physical trading floor, market information points (MIP), information and communication technology (ICT)-based platforms (short messaging service - SMS, interactive voice response service - IVRS, Internet based website and electronic database and radio), market resource centres (MRC), and a market call centre (MCC). Thus, the challenge experienced by KACE has been to find the right mix or portfolio of appropriate and affordable technology platforms, with complementary human skill and capacity, to efficiently manage the technologies, as well as the revenue flows, towards increased technical and financial sustainability. Despite the challenges, the KACE model continues to evolve and function, with a social entrepreneurial spirit of determination, to provide a solution to the social problem of poor smallholder farmers in Kenya, and God and technology willing, in the rest of Africa. The ICT platforms are being upgraded to improve technical and financial performance and efficiency, and the MRC staff are being trained to improve their capacity to generate and manage revenue efficiently.},

abstract={This paper discusses the role of social entrepreneurship and the discourse of techno-nationalism in defining national selfhood in contemporary Iran. To examine the issue, this paper develops an in-depth case study of the development of stem cell research, and shows how an alliance between the leaders of the scientific community and Iran's politico-religious authority contributed to building technological capacity in the field of stem cell research in the first decade of the twenty-first century. The paper also highlights how the preliminary success of stem cell research, along with other knowledge-intensive technologies, has created a shared feeling of national pride and has served as the material base for the contemporary discourse of techno-nationalism. The paper concludes with the notion that the techno-nationalist discourse has the inherent potential to unwittingly help to redefine the dichotomy between Iran and the West in such a way that it becomes less antagonistic, should other factors permit. © 2013 © 2013 The International Society for Iranian Studies.},

abstract={The purpose of this chapter is to explore the durability of social entrepreneurship (SE) identity gleaned from narrative accounts of SE. Specifically, this chapter draws on in-depth narrative interviews with five leading social entrepreneurs in the United Kingdom to explore the contested nature of this identity in broader third sector discourse. These interviews were collected at intervals over a period of 2 years (2010-2011), and were driven by the development of political projects (such as Big Society) aimed at creating a cohesive sense of third sector organisations. SEs are at once simply described but also ambiguously identified, and there are many conflicting opinions about the way forward for researchers in this area. Also, we recognise that broader discursive forces have a direct influence upon our understanding of organisational sense-making and identity. This chapter argues that the enforced ‘top-down’ approach to identity shaping by powerful political and economic discourse participants is only partly resisted by social entrepreneurs. The central research questions for this study are: What identities are portrayed of social entrepreneurs? And, are these constructions accepted or resisted? This research helps to address these questions through the narratives developed by social entrepreneurs in the UK. Using a discourse and content analysis frameworks, this chapter utilises this qualitative data to isolate the articulations of resistance to the imposed SE identity. Furthermore, it is possible to identify resistance, and even counter-discourse, among SEs that would be seen as ‘successful’ in terms of their organisational growth and measures of economic and social benefit. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014.},

Earlier reviews have provided the theoretical and methodological topography of the field and have noted the field’s highly fragmented nature across disciplines (Short et al., 2009; Dacin et al., 2010; Nicholls, 2010; Dacin et al., 2011). In this review, I use a ‘structuration’ approach to take stock of the knowledge developed within the management and business scholarships on social entrepreneurship. To this end, I reviewed the articles retrieved from the top 100 management and business journals indexed in the ISI Web of Knowledge Database (see Appendix 1). After reviewing this core literature, I added other literature cited by the authors around the core themes that emerge. In total my review draws from about a hundred and fifty articles. I find that the fundamental questions related to the rationale of social entrepreneurship and the ones that concern the definitional aspects of the social entrepreneurship are still very much in a work in progress. © Phillip H.

abstract={Social entrepreneurship is a promising approach toward solving social issues and societal problems by applying business techniques with an entrepreneurial mindset (for example, Dees, 1998; Light, 2008; Zahra et al., 2009). The visible success of social enterprises supported and promoted by fellowship associations such as the Skoll Foundation, Ashoka or the Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship has helped social entrepreneurship gain a prominent role in policy debates (Cohen, 2011; European Commission, 2011) and become an investment focus for foundations and venture philanthropy funds (Achleitner et al., in press). Venture philanthropy funds are investors who use multi-stage selection processes and analyze a wide range of investment criteria (Achleitner and Heister, 2009; Scarlata and Alemany, 2009). They constitute one of the most sophisticated capital providers in the social sector. Within the selection process they analyze a range of different topics such as the social problem itself, the capabilities and personality of the social entrepreneur and, especially, the concept of the social enterprise. The research questions addressed in this chapter are linked to each other. First, we are interested in what company-specific criteria investment managers use in their selection process and what role these play in the selection process. © Phillip H.

abstract={Those who study the development of societies have considered entrepreneurial capital accumulation as the engine that drives economic growth (Van Stel et al., 2005). Evidence from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) shows that growth in gross domestic product (GDP) and the employment rate of a country increase with more venture startups (Zacharakis et al., 1999). Entrepreneurs are important economic engines of any country’s growth because they not only accelerate the generation, application, and spread of innovative ideas but also ensure the efficient use of resources and expand the boundaries of a country’s economic activities (Reynolds et al., 1999). Interest in rural entrepreneurship in developed countries has increased in recent years because traditional economic activity in manufacturing has struggled to remain competitive in the face of increased global competition (Marke and Markley, 2006). In rural areas hardest hit by economic stagnation, entrepreneurship is a solution to reignite economic development (Ozgen and Minsky, 2007). Policymakers thus look to rural entrepreneurship as a solution to difficulties encountered in regional wealth creation. In developing countries, economic development has traditionally been a top-down process in which aid money filters through a bureaucratic chain before reaching its beneficiaries. Without the inclusion of training and capacity building, such passive beneficiaries often become dependent on continuing government programs to fund consumption (Maxwell, 2003). © Phillip H.

The challenges include the high cost and the difficulty in acquiring land in urban areas, dealing with anachronistic government regulations, getting bank loans, and acquiring customers from the target segment. The conversation highlights how Janaadhar was able to grapple with these challenges, sometimes by innovating, at other times by learning from its own mistakes and finally by maintaining a dynamic balance between the "head and the heart" that enabled it to reconcile two contradictory objectives of leveraging market principles to achieve a social objective. © 2014 .},

abstract={All of the great American Entrepreneurs from Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, David Packard and Steve Jobs, had a driving theme to their entrepreneurship: a burning desire to contribute something great to society. It defined their entrepreneurism and fueled their passion and relentless pursuit of their dreams (Isaacson 2011). Today’s business model focuses primarily on shareholder returns, which characterizes much of the prevailing model of capitalism around the globe. This would be the least interesting driver for these visionaries, and in most cases they had to fight hard to keep their vision from the clutches and narrow interests of their investors. For the true entrepreneur there is little distance between the business model and the role of business in society. In fact the ultimate measure of a business is its contribute to society. This vision seems a far cry from the trajectory of the reigning business model. Even more telling is the relentless pursuit of a bottom line measured primarily by profit and loss statements. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

It is argued that a better approach to success would be to base these startup decisions on the "Solution" and the nature of the "Who" is impacted by the problem rather than the gravity of the JTBD.

abstract={Purpose - Social entrepreneurs create novel approaches to social problems such as poverty. But scaling these approaches to the dimension of the problem can be a difficult task. In the social enterprise sector, the subject of scaling has become a key dimension of organizational performance. This chapter advances the scholarly literature on the scaling of social enterprises, a literature which is currently in an embryonic stage and characterized by conceptual ambiguity and fragmented perspectives. Methodology/Approach - We engage realist philosophy of science to develop mechanism-based causal explanations of the scaling performance of social enterprises. We also develop a coding scheme to guide systematic empirical analysis and highlight the explanatory power of counterfactuals. Counterfactuals have been largely neglected in empirical research as they represent mechanisms that are enabled but remain unobservable - in a state of suppression or neutralization of their effects. Findings - We question the ability of organizations to "socially engineer" desired outcomes and introduce a new construct-organizational closure competence. Anchored in realism, this construct provides a basis for productive approaches to social engineering. We elaborate on the importance of organizational closure competencies for scaling, derive a series of propositions, and develop ideas for future research and for practice. Research, Practical and Social Implications - Applying a realist lens allows us to add empirical rigor to research on social enterprises and scaling. Our approach constitutes a move from rich narratives to causal models and informs the way we design and evaluate efforts to address important societal challenges. Originality/Value of Chapter - This chapter demonstrates how to operationalize realist philosophy of science for causal explanations of complex social phenomena and better utilize its theoretical and practical value. © 2014 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose - The purpose of this chapter is to document the use of Participatory Action Research methods as an effective approach for community empowerment and strategies for more inclusive public policy. Design/methodology - The methodology draws on a "participatory video" project with recycling cooperatives in São Paulo, Brazil, and documents the process, benefits, and challenges of using action-oriented methods and tools as an approach to build capacity for political and social change. The authors provide a step-by-step process of facilitating a PV project, its application for policy engagement, and some of the major dilemmas in using PV, including representation, power, and vulnerability. Findings - The research findings conclude that the application of Participatory Action Research as a research method in social entrepreneurship, contributes significantly to build transformative capacity in participating members, in addition to creating new spaces for inclusive policy. Originality/value - The research is unique in that it points to creative and transformative methods of engagement for inclusive governance, embracing multiple forms of personal identity, knowledge and creative expression in moving toward new solutions for equal opportunities and possibilities for change. Participatory video is argued to be an innovative avenue for the inclusion of multiple voices in these arenas, voices of people otherwise left on the margins. Participatory video is an approach that has the potential to transform the way we (local and global) move toward greater social equity, human compassion, and environmental flourishing. © 2014 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The case describes the first year of efforts to introduce microfinance as a tool to work with vulnerable groups in Sweden, more particularly ex-convicts, former drug-addicts and longterm unemployed women of immigrant background. The teaching objective is to discuss whether micro-finance can be seen as a tool to catalyze social change in developed welfare states such as Sweden, or if it rather reinforces the very power structures it aims to subvert. The author uses the case to analyse the efforts to introduce a new concept to wellestablished economic and social actors, as well as to understand the difficulties of building collaborations between actors with different logics. The analysis is threefold: 1. The mobilization and generation of social capital; 2. The conflict of logics/frames; 3. The frame alignment process set in motion by micro-finance The case is based on extended field research. It was written for students of social entrepreneurship. It has also been tested on students enrolled in the Philosophy and Economy Masters Program. In late-March 2009, Linda Sandberg, leader for the introduction of microfinance in Sweden by the Swedish Association for Savings Banks, was considering relations with Feem (Forum for Entrepreneurs from Ethnic Minorities), the pilot project's non-profit partner. Relations had deteriorated culminating in accusations of plagiarism. Fredrik, Linda's supervisor, had asked her for an analysis of the tensions for their next meeting scheduled in one hour. © 2013 by Jordan Whitney Enterprises, Inc, Arden NC, USA.},

abstract={Misdiagnosis of malaria is a major problem in Africa leading not only to incorrect individual level treatment, but potentially the acceleration of the spread of drug resistance in low-transmission areas. In this paper we report on the outcomes of a simple intervention that utilized a social entrepreneurship approach (SEA) to reduce misdiagnosis associated with hospital-based microscopy of malaria in a low-transmission area of rural Tanzania. A pre-post assessment was conducted on patients presenting to the hospital outpatient department with malaria and non-malaria like symptoms in January 2009 (pre-intervention) and June 2009 (post-intervention). All participants were asked a health seeking behavior questionnaire and blood samples were taken for local and quality control microscopy. Multivariate logistic regression was conducted to determine magnitude of misdiagnosis with local microscopy pre- versus- post intervention. Local microscopy pre-intervention specificity was 29.5% (95% CI = 21.6% - 38.4%) whereas the post intervention specificity was 68.6% (95% CI = 60.2% - 76.2%). Both pre and post intervention sensitivity were difficult to determine due to an unexpected low number of true positive cases. The proportion of participants misdiagnosed pre-intervention was 70.2% (95%CI = 61.3%-78.0%) as compared to 30.6% (95%CI = 23.2%-38.8%) post-intervention. This resulted in a 39.6% reduction in misdiagnosis of malaria at the local hospital. The magnitude of misdiagnosis for the pre-intervention participants was 5.3 (95%CI = 3.1-9.3) that of the post-intervention participants. In conclusion, this study provides evidence that a simple intervention can meaningfully reduce the magnitude of microscopy-based misdiagnosis of malaria for those individuals seeking treatment for uncomplicated malaria. We anticipate that this intervention will facilitate a valuable and sustainable change in malaria diagnosis at the local hospital.},

Despite all these potential obstacles, there are social innovations that go from promising ideas to becoming mainstream solutions, leading to new markets, industries, or social movements, such as Microfinance or Wikipedia.

abstract={Public spaces constitute one of the first urban elements to be threatened in times of instability. Their efficient supply and management becomes a concern for both public authorities and individual users. This paper examines the role and objectives of social entrepreneurs in supplying temporary public spaces within an unstable setting and focuses on small group collective action. The mechanisms used to identify potential land, negotiate use-rights and promote these spaces are discussed for the case of Beirut, Lebanon, a society segregated by the effects of war and political upheaval. The case of an organic food market is used to illustrate temporary public spaces in the critical period of 2005-2007, when political instability reigned in the country and rendered conventional public spaces undesirable. The paper concludes by drawing lessons for land readjustment in crisis situations from the movement of temporary public spaces within a city while still attracting people that formerly had difficulties meeting elsewhere.},

The departure point is an overview of social change theories, highlighting Kurt Lewin's 'force fields' change theory and Andrzej Nowak's 'bubbles' theory of social change. Next, we describe the phenomenon of social entrepreneurship and the role of the individual in introducing social change. Then we explore what are the specific methods used by social entrepreneurs that, by enhancing trust and the propensity for cooperation, empower their communities. Also we present field research analyzing the results achieved by social entrepreneurs, especially their impact on the people and societies in the places where they operate. We conclude that social entrepreneurs launch change process that are multi-pronged and that have long-term results on the individual as well as societal levels. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Purpose - The purpose of this article is to demonstrate how funding support for intergenerational initiatives can have a positive impact on individuals and communities. The author aims to argue that there are strong motivations for organisations and associations supported by local and national government to adopt intergenerational approaches to their work and to outline areas where need for future work remains. Design/methodology/approach - The paper describes learning gained from initiatives supported through a four-year funding programme by the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation. Highlighting research by a range of parties on the need for and value of intergenerational work, the article moves on to describing key success factors identified through its own programme of work in creating high impact intergenerational work. Findings - Drawing on experience gained from the support of some 50 projects under the Foundation's programme, a number of key elements are identified in the paper as particularly effective in creating successful intergenerational initiatives with significant impact: commonality - a common interest or goal shared among the different ages; co-design - involve beneficiaries in developing activities; contribution - recognise that every participant has something to offer; community - house the work with key local players; competences - support and train staff to work with different ages. Originality/value - Extending the literature base on the value of intergenerational practice, the article draws learning from a range of innovative projects in the UK and Portugal, where intergenerational work is still uncommon. The programme of funding was innovative in applying new approaches to intergenerational work including co-design and social entrepreneurship. The article represents the first comparative analysis of a range of projects funded through the programme. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Social innovation and development have to be placed in the perspective of sustainability. Overcoming poverty and pauperisation is not only an issue for the Third World; however, the so-called developed nations, i.e. mainly the OECD countries, are facing increasing social inequality and pauperisation after their short dream of ever-lasting prosperity (Lutz 1984). Mini-credits have been regarded as a means of overcoming pauperisation first in Third World countries, later in developed countries as well, and the idea has been compensated by the Nobel Prize for peace in 2006. But not only since the recent conflict about its initiator, Muhammad Yunus, there has been rising critique, especially in India. Strategies for sustainability include Corporate Social Responsibility, the development of a strong civil society, the quality of democratic participation, and by it strengthening the trade unions as the largest democratic institutions in our societies. Civil society is not only in the core of democratisation but also for social innovation. Since the Age of Enlightenment science and its institutions are the centre for innovation and social innovation. The reference here is not only in regard to Schumpeter but for Karl Polanyi too. Since the 1970s there is a debate about zero growth and alternative measurements for the quality of life and working life, beyond GDP (Széll, G., & Széll, U. (Eds.) (2009).

Some suggest that corporations should aim to regain legitimacy by pursuing shared value rather than mere financial value. Managers may be able to look at the field of social entrepreneurship to learn how to create such shared value. This chapter presents the concept of social entrepreneurship and introduces two areas in which social entrepreneurs have created novel business models: microfinance and social impact investing. The lessons that can be learned for shared value creation are discussed for the financial industry as a whole and those interested in socially responsible finance. The chapter concludes by presenting several caveats. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Urban development projects, or targeted spatial interventions driven by property logics and aiming at delivering social and economic benefits, became increasingly popular as a spatial planning device in the push for the creation of more competitive urban environments. This chapter shows how the transformation of a large-scale industrial complex in Montreal (Angus Technopolis), a special form of urban project, gave rise to a new distribution of roles and responsibilities between community organisations, union-related organisations, private business and public actors. It is argued that tensions arise between the expansion of the urban neoliberal agenda (through stimulation of a more entrepreneurial civil society); and the potential for new forms of collective action. The analysis of the emergence of a ‘not-for-profit developer’ in the Angus case suggests the potential for social entrepreneurship, incorporating broad socio-economic objectives in the delivery of urban spatial policy. However, it is also shows the emergence of new constraints and the risk of instrumentalisation of community-based organisations when civil society groups take the entrepreneurial turn. © 2012, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Pre- and post-test surveys were administered at the beginning and toward the end of the fall 2010 semester. Results indicated that while there is no statistically significant difference between groups at pre-test, the enhanced instruction group showed greater knowledge on social entrepreneurship and sustainable development on post-test than the comparison group. The enhanced instruction group also showed a statistically significant difference on their perceived importance of gaining understanding and knowledge of business skills in social work education than did the comparison group. The enhanced instruction group reported a combination of learning methods effective in understanding social entrepreneurship and sustainable development. The findings have important implications for social work education and practice.

abstract={As part of the reauthorization of the National and Community Service Act of 1990, the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act (P.L. 111-13) established a Social Innovation Fund (SIF) to invest in social entrepreneurs and other non-profit community organizations in the United States. The intent of the legislation is to provide funding that will enable individuals and organizations to develop "innovative and effective solutions to national and local challenges." The law requires that federal funds be matched on a one-for-one basis by the grant-making organizations and on a one-for-one basis by sub-grantees (i.e., the community organizations). This match is designed to leverage Federal investment with funding from private and other sources. In FY20 10, $50 million was appropriated to the SIF and, for FY20 11, $60 million has been requested in the President's budget. Concurrently, the Obama administration created the White House Office of Social Innovation and Civic Participation, under the Domestic Policy Council which, among other things, seeks to encourage social innovation and support community solutions. Other legislative and government initiatives-such as H.R. 5191, S. 1425, and H.R. 5533-have similarly incorporated "social entrepreneurship" and "social innovation" into efforts to address such issues as economic opportunity, education, and international development. Social entrepreneurship? describes the efforts of highly motivated individuals and organizations to solve economic and social problems for the benefit of society in general through the use of business methods and innovative strategies. These solutions are the result of the application of new resources or new combinations of existing resources and of the mobilization of diverse funding mechanisms which increase the sustainability, quality, and scalability of social enterprises. Interest and involvement in this model have grown substantially over the past thirty to forty years among development organizations, the nonprofit sector, universities, and governments around the world. However, the evidence and research base is lagging. As a result of a number of factors, proponents of social entrepreneurship have adopted differing definitions of the term-sometimes depending on their audience. One major issue is the lack of common understanding of definitions and a statistical base for measuring achievement. The field frequently relies on anecdotal evidence rather than empirical data. This report provides an overview and analysis of the differing interpretations of social entrepreneurship, provides a review and discussion of its contributions, examines some case studies, and details recent legislation, as well as legislative proposals and legislative options.

abstract={Australia is a nation of immigrants. Immigration brings much needed skills and labour to Australia. It helps creating a strong economy, drives prosperity and builds Australia's future. Diverse cultural expression enriches all Australians and makes the multicultural nation more vibrant and creative. Immigrants, including refugees, from non-English speaking backgrounds (NESB) are vulnerable as they often have higher unemployment rates or are at an earnings disadvantage that may lead to disaffection and community unrest in the long run. Government agencies are facing complicated issues surrounding the design and implementation of strategies that facilitate the settlement of new arrivals in Australia. This paper critically reviews the literature and argues that social enterprises and social entrepreneurship can help to facilitate life satisfaction and self-reliance for NESB immigrants in Australia. In addition, the paper provides a better understanding of what research method may best suit to examine the role of social enterprises in NESB immigrant settlement experiences and how social enterprises may help to integrate the immigrants into a culturally diverse socially cohesive nation. Discussion of benefits of the proposed research method will also be provided. © Common Ground, Eric Kong, All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={Interest in market-based approaches to solving development challenges continues to grow. The water and sanitation sector is no exception, although discussion has been coloured by experience with public-private partnerships (PPPs). Yet the number of PPP contracts in the developing world is very limited, especially by comparison to the multitude of small, often informal, enterprises active in water or sanitation. With fewer than half of Africans connected to water or sewerage networks, arguably it is these smaller providers, many entrepreneurial in nature, that are most relevant to the development community. Whilst the existence of these providers has been known for some time, a workable modus operandi for engaging with them is still being developed. There are significant political and economic challenges to integrating them within public sector programmes. This article explores the different markets in water and sanitation provision and the roles that entrepreneurship plays. It argues that, with global interest in social entrepreneurship rising, the water and sanitation sector is well placed to capitalize on a hidden strength. © Practical Action Publishing, 2011.},

Thirdly, they will detail their main features obtained from the study of twelve inititatives - the most relevant at present - which they have called 2.0 social enterprises (peer to peer charities and e-social banking). The authors will finally offer some reflection on main dilemmas and challenges that could be faced in a short term future. © 2010, IGI Global.},

abstract={This article analyzes the function, design, and effects of a method to assess the performance of housing associations in the Netherlands. First, the roles of performance assessment are discussed from three perspectives: the association as an agent for the central government; the association as a facilitator of local stakeholders' needs; and the association as an autonomous social entrepreneur. From each of these stereotypical perspectives, we derive the approaches to and functions of performance assessment. The resulting theoretical archetypes of performance assessment are then employed to analyze the method that was in place in 2005 in the Netherlands. The performance assessment system is also analyzed using the director, detector, and effector elements drawn from cybernetic theory. Furthermore, the Dutch performance assessment method is briefly compared with the English inspection system. This provides a better understanding of the types of performance assessment. In light of the identified perspectives on housing associations, we conclude that the Dutch method performs poorly on the director and effector element and that the English method performs relatively well on all elements. Nevertheless, in both countries adjustments in the performance assessment system can increase learning and improve the performance of housing associations. © The Author(s) 2009.},

abstract={A headmaster is a leader of a primary school and the determinant factor of success in every aspects of the primary school. He holds major duties and responsibilities in ensuring that the teachers complete their tasks in educating the students well and making sure that the students can study successfully. Besides that, a headmaster should also make sure that the physical aspects of the school are clean, neat, safe and adequate. To fulfill these challenging tasks, a headmaster has to be excellent in administrating his school. Because of that, a headmaster who has the entrepreneurship characteristics is a headmaster who can succeed in administrating his school. This is because an entrepreneur is usually creative, innovative, understands the risks and competitions, able to get hold of opportunities and giving others opportunities especially teachers and students in his school. This study is done to attempt the competency analysis of self-entrepreneurship of 106 headmasters who has participated or are still participating in the Teachers' Post-Graduating Special Program in Universiti Pendidikan Sultan Idris. In this study, the headmasters (the respondents) have been given questionnaires to evaluate their self-entrepreneurship competency by themselves. 13 characteristics of entrepreneurship which consists of 70 questions have been given to the headmasters. The entrepreneurship characteristics are initiative, the observing and seizing of opportunities, perseverance, information retrieval, high work quality focus, duty commitment, orientation towards higher capability, systematic planning, problem solving qualities, confidence, resoluteness, good persuasion capabilities and the ability to use influence strategy. The study showed that the entrepreneurship characteristics within the headmasters are average and poor in "initiative" and "information retrieval". It is suggested that the education of entrepreneurship is added to the preparation courses for headmasters so that they can be social entrepreneurs who can always opportunities and provide opportunities to teachers and students in their respective schools.},

abstract={Be bold – allow yourself to envision a life-conducive economy Throughout this book, authors from diverse personal and academic backgrounds have argued that the purpose of economic activity should be to serve mankind. This may look somewhat idealistic or even naïve at first sight. However, we believe the arguments presented in this book build a strong case for working towards a more life-conducive economy. We have learned that there have been humanistic principles throughout history, within different religious and cultural traditions across the globe, as well as in the development of economic thought. In practice, we also increasingly find examples of humanists using entrepreneurial means to foster genuine life-serving developments, while topics such as business ethics, social entrepreneurship, and corporate social responsibility continuously deepen their footprint in management education and research. Clearly, building a more life-conducive economy and redefining the role of business in society accordingly means aiming high. Simultaneously, we should realize that our economic activities are not governed by laws of nature, but follow man-made rules. We chose to adopt these rules and, consequently, we can also choose to change them or at least allow them to evolve in the light of new knowledge – free of (sometimes dogmatic) status quo conserving defense mechanisms. If one is asked to decide whether changes in any context are positive or not, one depends on a vision of a desired outcome. © Cambridge University Press 2009.},

It proposes that the social, political and economic factors giving rise to shifting priorities in this newly named "third" sector are encapsulated in the notion of social entrepreneurship being given impetus by the Federal Government's policy of mutual obligation, the findings of the Welfare Reform Group and the consequent Australians Working Together programme. It argues that community development is the ideal strategy for partnership development that fits well with the strengths perspective, where the emphasis is on mutual engagement in an equal relationship such that the collective assets and resources of the collaborating partners can be harnessed for the good of the community. The parallels between partnerships and human relationships are outlined and the role of the key sectors of community, business, government and non-government in the provision of social services are discussed. The paper ends with a discussion of community-business partnership development. Partnerships are seen to offer social workers with opportunities and challenges in the development of creative and innovative programmes aimed at social improvement.},

Empirical results based on the GEM Adult Population Survey 2015 show that extractive businesses are more likely to engage in social initiatives than non-extractive ones. However, both types of businesses show moderate commitment to social and environmental aspects of social entrepreneurship, such as reinvestment of profits and impact. This evidence lends mild support to the notion of a social license to operate. On the other hand, a structural equation model for the social entrepreneurial process shows that social awareness is fostered by a strong social entrepreneurial culture and strict protection of property rights, and led by extractive, innovative and growing businesses. This evidence suggests that social awareness may be a mechanism to facilitate long-term sustainability and moderate social license concerns. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

We find no gender differences in human capital before starting a nonprofit. We find gendered differences in founding approaches—women are more likely to take on full-time roles during the start-up phase and utilize volunteers, while men take on more financial debt. Although gender differences between nonprofit founders are not as extensive as those found among traditional and social entrepreneurs, our findings indicate more equitable opportunities for female nonprofit entrepreneurs. These findings highlight the opportunities for interrogating the gendering of nonprofit development. © The Author(s) 2021.},

abstract={Background: Social enterprises are organizations created to address social problems that use business models to sustain themselves financially. Social enterprises can help increase access to primary health care in low resource settings. Research on social enterprises in health care have focused either on high-income countries, or on secondary and tertiary care in low- and middle-income countries, where common business models include differential pricing to cross-subsidize low income populations. This is the first study to examine social enterprises providing primary health care in low- and middle-income countries using primary data. The purpose is to determine whether social enterprise is a viable model in this setting and to identify common patterns and characteristics that could inform the work of social entrepreneurs, funders, and researchers in this area. Methods: We identify social entrepreneurs working to deliver primary health care in low- and middle-income countries who have been vetted by international organizations dedicated to supporting social entrepreneurship. Through in-depth interviews, we collect information on medical processes, business processes, social impact, and organizational impact according to the Battacharyya et al. framework. We then conducted qualitative analysis to identify common patterns emerging within these four categories. Results: Common characteristics in the business models of primary health care social enterprises include flat rate rather than differential pricing and cross-subsidizing across services rather than patients. Subscription packages and in-house IT systems were utilized to generate revenue and increase reach through telemedicine, franchising, and mobile units. In some cases, alternate revenue streams are employed to help break even. About half of the social enterprises interviewed were for-profit, and about half non-profit. The majority faced challenges in engaging with the public sector. This is still a nascent field, with most organizations being under 10 years old. Conclusions: Social enterprise has been demonstrated as a feasible model for providing primary health care in low resource settings, with key characteristics differing from the previously commonly studied social enterprises in tertiary care. There are opportunities to complement existing public health systems, but most organizations face challenges in doing so. More research and attention is needed by researchers, governments and funders to support social entrepreneurs and avoid parallel systems. © 2021, The Author(s).},

Findings: Results show that both conditional resources and social entrepreneurial intent are significantly associated with social entrepreneurial action. Results further indicate that social entrepreneurial intent partially mediates the relationship between conditional resources and social entrepreneurial action.

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the struggle of and explore opportunity structure for a special class of social entrepreneurs, known as musicpreneurs, in the context of a war-ridden conflict region of Pakistan. A unique case of Pashtun musicians is undertaken, who are confronted with multiple challenges and barriers while commercializing their musical skills. It provides a holistic account of a journey towards self-sustenance from the perspective of real-life musicpreneurs living in harsh socio-economic conditions. Design/methodology/approach: This research is guided by constructionism and interpretive methodology, where semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted from 28 entrepreneurs in Peshawar, capital city of the Khyber Pakhtunkwa Province and its surroundings. Qualitative thematic analysis was used to analyze transcribed data. Findings: This research categorizes all findings into seven unified themes. A common Pashtun shows profound love for music, yet surprisingly, does not extend the same intensity of love to musicians. Till recently, Pashtun musicpreneurs are confronted by multiple challenges and barriers such as copyright violations, socio-cultural resistance and discrimination. However, they have devised new opportunity structures to commercialize their skills and adopt music as a sustainable career. Research limitations/implications: This research explored multiple aspects of Pashtun musicpreneurs’ lives, compromising minute details on some aspects, for example, limited opportunity structure for musicpreneurs. It bears implications not only for Pakistan but other similar hostile environments for musicpreneurship. For lasting sustainability, overall tranquility and for the promotion of musicpreneurship, challenges surrounding musicpreneurs need to be addressed. Originality/value: It is the first study of its kind to explore the struggle of musicpreneurs in hostile socio-economic conditions. From theoretical standpoint, a new theory of musicpreneurship is substantiated by paving ways to resolve barriers experienced in the most unfavourable conditions. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Social entrepreneurs are often at the forefront of remedying complex societal issues by linking the entrepreneurial mindset with approaches to solving these systemic societal issues. We build upon existing notions regarding the field of social entrepreneurship and existing forms of social entrepreneurship while deepening the understanding of the different roles that social entrepreneurs must embody on a daily basis. Agency theory is used by identifying principal and agent factors underlying social entrepreneurship in terms of role stressors and role conflict. We outline varying types of social entrepreneurs and discuss role duality, an area with room for much exploration. We also identify and discuss problems for principals and agents within these types of social entrepreneurship. Thus we contribute to the literature (1) by extending on the types of social entrepreneurs, (2) by identifying the threats that social entrepreneurs face through an agency lens; namely the dual role that social entrepreneurs must embark upon, and (3) by describing the boundary conditions of the different social entrepreneur types, we link the potential challenges of social entrepreneurship with a deeper look into the growing domain that is social entrepreneurship. © 2021, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Purpose: Social enterprises can be found across Vietnam. However, little is known about how these organizations contribute to the country’s broader efforts to meet the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This paper aims to explore whether and to what extent differences in social impacts by social enterprises may be explained by the psychological characteristics of social entrepreneurs and cross-sector “ecosystem” partnerships in training, networking, consultation and funding. Design/methodology/approach: A survey of N ≈ 352 Vietnamese social entrepreneurs explored relationships between individual entrepreneurial orientation (EO), social identity, self-construal and personality, with elements of ecosystem partnerships (access to training, networking, consultation and funding) and social impacts over the previous three years (growth/jobs created and people helped, termed efficiency and generosity, respectively). Findings: Ecosystem partnerships factored into frequency and quality of partnerships. Frequency predicted social enterprise efficiency (p < 0.05) and quality predicted generosity (p < 0.01). Frequency of partnerships further moderated (boosted) significant links between EO (risk innovation, p < 0.05) and efficiency; and between social identity (communitarianism, p < 0.01) to efficiency; plus, quality of partnerships moderated a link between EO (risk innovation) and efficiency (p < 0.05). Practical implications: Ecosystem partnerships may foster social enterprise development through at least two pathways (equifinality), i.e. frequency and quality. The former is linked to efficiency and the latter to generosity, signaling interrelates but distinguishable outcomes. Direct links between EO and communitarian social identity leading to social enterprise development were additionally boosted (p < 0.05) by the frequency and quality of partnerships. Thus, ecosystem partnerships brought about both direct and indirect benefits to social enterprises in Vietnam. Social implications: Social impacts of efficiency and generosity support both decent work (SDG-8) and poverty eradication (SDG-1), through ecosystem partnerships in development (SDG-17). Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first empirical study to show that social enterprises in Vietnam may enhance social impacts through a combination of effects from social entrepreneurs and ecosystem partnerships. Current models of social enterprises in low-income countries like Vietnam can be expanded to include ecosystem partnerships and social outcomes relating to SDGs 1 and 8, and especially the multiple path benefits that ecosystem partnerships (under SDG-17) bring to social enterprise development. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Social entrepreneurs aim to create societal value while pursuing financial sustainability. However, they typically face several challenges and constraints when operating in resource-scarce environments. For this reason, social entrepreneurs typically engage in entrepreneurial bricolage, which is described as a process of using whatever tools and resources necessary that are immediately available. The behavioral theory of entrepreneurial bricolage attempts to understand what entrepreneurs do when faced with resource constraints. In this vital process, little empirical research has been conducted to investigate what drives social entrepreneurs to engage in such a way. This study aims to understand the antecedents of bricolage and, in particular, empirically test its link to intellectual capital. A survey was administered to 115 social entrepreneurs from Ghana and Sierra Leone. Data analysis shows that relational capital plays a crucial role in driving social entrepreneurs to engage with bricolage. In fact, the quality of local relationships and external support received (by suppliers, customers, and communities) is positively related and statistically significant with entrepreneurial bricolage. The results of this study not only extend the academic literature of bricolage in social entrepreneurship but also point out the focal role of relational capital as an enabler toward effectively operating in difficult conditions in developing African countries. We thus provide theoretical implications to the field of social entrepreneurship through the lens of intellectual capital and knowledge management. Practical implications are provided to social entrepreneurs operating in developing countries, such as government, NGOs, and agencies seeking to support entrepreneurship initiatives. Limitations and future research opportunities are suggested as well. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={This study is aimed at examining the relationships between social capital, social motivation and functional competencies and their effects on the participation in the development of an agri-tourism business among Tunisian entrepreneurs who already have rural lodges in the agritourism sector in Tunisia. The authors applied structural modeling of the partial least squares equation to analyze 100 questionnaires completed by participants and test the hypotheses. The results showed positive and direct effects concerning the two variables, namely, the social capital and functional competencies on the participation in the development of a business in agritourism. On the other hand, the mediating role of social motivation between social capital and participation in the development of an agritourism business has shown an insignificant effect. This study creates a distinctive theoretical contribution to the literature on social entrepreneurial factors by analyzing the relationships between social capital, social motivation and functional competencies of an entrepreneur on participation in the development of a business in agritourism.

Students were given challenges related to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) during the course and were allowed to recognize their interest in solving these problems. This paper seeks to identify the entrepreneurial profile of university students through their experiences, interests, attitudes, and entrepreneurial skills. Although entrepreneurship courses are offered more frequently in universities, it is necessary to know the characteristics of the students’ interest and their abilities to continue strengthening them. The data were collected through a questionnaire conducted with 20 multidisciplinary participants. The analysis compared the results of those who finished the course vs. those who did not to determine the significant differences in their answers. The results showed that the participants generated sustainable business ideas that favor local and global problems. Additionally, the students showed great interest in social entrepreneurship and developing companies based on the knowledge acquired during their university studies. It is recommended to continue with the training so that these ideas can become real ventures through linkages with other actors in the entrepreneurial ecosystem and favor the solution of sustainable problems. The questionnaire instrument enabled identifying the students’ characteristics, interests, and entrepreneurial skills, which could be strengthened with other programs that train them. It was also possible to recognize skills that they did not possess before starting the e-learning course which require further strengthening. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={The European Union has incorporated impact investment through two action plans: the Social Entrepreneurship Initiative and the Investment Plan for Europe. These financing tools seek to fund economic growth and promote job creation. Among the different measures carried out, the regulatory framework for impact investment funds stands out, under which the denomination, European Social Entrepreneurship Fund, is established to designate investment funds focused on social enterprises with the objective of generating a positive impact. It is possible to affirm that the creation of a solid impact intermediation infrastructure, by connecting both sides of supply and demand, is a critical aspect for the development and effective functioning of the impact market. Special importance is given to impact funds capable of attracting private capital. In order to categorise the different impact funds according to the most relevant aspects, a proposal form for the characterisation of impact funds has been drawn up and has been applied to a particular case. The presentation of Creas will allow for contextualising the practices that impact funds carry out and facilitate the general understanding of the article through a specific example that is considered successful in Spain. © 2021 by the authors.},

Aligned with 2030 Agenda for the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, it is important to clarify the role of social entrepreneurs, as they are making visible the impact of their creative ideas in several areas, from civic engagement to the environment, health and learning. The main purpose of this study is to specify a model of social entrepreneurial intention (SEI) and explore it by country, based on the dimensions of the Theory of Planned Behavior and how these are mediated by spirituality and optimism. With a convenience sample of 1476 Portuguese and Spanish students, Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used. For a deeply understanding, variables within the model were compared by country using t-rest, and multivariate analysis was done by each one separately. The mean comparison between countries, demonstrated that there are differences only between perceived behavioral control (PBC), Spirituality, Optimism and SEI, with Portuguese students scoring the highest values, in all variables except Optimism. A mediation path was carried out, and Spirituality mediate a significant effect between the three TPB dimensions in Portuguese students, but not in students from Spain. Finally, after discussing the results, theoretical and practical contributions are analyzed, with regard to the field of SE in Portugal and Spain, and alternatives are pointed out for a more social and sustainable entrepreneurial future. © Copyright © 2021 Margaça, Hernández-Sánchez, Cardella and Sánchez-García.},

abstract={In the last two decades, social innovation (SI) and social entrepreneurship (SE) have gained relevance and interest within the framework of academia at international level. Higher education institutions (HEIs) are key players in promoting innovation and social entrepreneurship initiatives that respond to multifaceted challenges. They support strategies on the basis of the strengthening of participation, collaboration, and cooperation with society and its local communities. However, the approach of Latin American universities to SI and SE has been very uneven in the way they have understood them, integrated them into academic programmes, and transferred knowledge to society. On the basis of the experience of the Students4Change project, we sought to understand the role of Latin American HEIs in promoting social innovations by analysing the experiences of 10 participating universities to formalise a pedagogical programme on SI and SE in their institutions. The results suggest that there is still a need to formalise an academic syllabus that is specifically designed to promote social innovations and to train universities in this endeavour. This paper contributes to the identification of the main levers of change, strengths, and challenges that Latin American universities face to institutionalise SI and SE in their contexts. © 2021 by the authors.

Based on information from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor 2015, the empirical analysis shows that the availability of external sources of financing depend primarily on demographics, entrepreneurial experience, business features, e.g., export propensity and growth potential; and, on the phase of economic development. Furthermore, relatively high levels of social trust may increase the likelihood of obtaining external financing. The novelty of the product/service offered, financial barriers and investor/property rights protection in turn may also explain the proportion of self-investment provided to a new business. An analysis of financing options of socially-oriented businesses shows that they are more successful in obtaining financial support from private investors/venture capitalists and governments. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

The scale of the problem requires innovative approaches to bring about change. One such approach is the development of a sustainable food system in combination with the leadership of Pacific youth. This study sought to engage Pacific youth as part of the solution to reducing NCDs through social enterprise and championing of sustainable food systems. Four young Fijian vegetable and fruit entrepreneurs shared their stories as part of a participatory action research of Talanoa/storytelling, with social media workshops, networking and promotional opportunities. Findings revealed that youth entrepreneurs are passionate about food and health, family and tradition; some are already food influencers and champions and they are keen to grow their businesses. Yet, there is limited support for small business development with a social purpose and youth-led campaigns. The study indicates a growing potential to develop local youth-led social entrepreneurship and innovation to address NCDs in exciting new ways. There is an urgent need to support innovation interventions to advocate for sustainable food systems for the Pacific, that promote positive human health needs and address, more broadly, climate change effects. © 2020 The Author(s).},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this study is to identify how the value dynamics of the freemium business model (BM) play out in a social enterprise. Design/methodology/approach: We draw on a multiple case study of two social enterprises –one nonprofit (Aravind Eyecare) in Asia and one for-profit in Latin America (Biodent)– to analyze the implications of applying the value architecture of a freemium BM to social enterprises. Findings: The freemium BM departs from standard practice when applied in social enterprises. Meaningful differences include the feasibility/desirability of converting free users to paying ones, the presence of significant variable costs –which requires balancing the ratio of free and paying customers– and the use of nontraditional pricing schemes to enhance value capture. The social freemium BM can increase scalability, value creation and value capture. Under this model, “beneficiaries” can be more than passive recipients of value and contribute to a venture's success in various ways –such as lowering its operational costs or enhancing its value proposition toward third parties. Originality/value: While in the past years commercial enterprises have been disrupted by the emergence of freemium platforms, the social enterprise field has barely taken notice. We extract lessons and implications from this paradigmatic change for the theory and practice of business model innovation in social enterprises, of particular relevance to Latin America, where social and environmental disequilibria remain a recurring feat. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Understanding the antecedents of social entrepreneurship is critical for unleashing the potential of social entrepreneurship and thus for tackling social problems. While research has provided valuable insights into imprinting of the conventional entrepreneur, research on differences between social and conventional entrepreneurship suggests that social entrepreneurs evolve differently. Using survey data of 148 social entrepreneurs, we draw on the concepts of imprinting and critical incident recognition as a framework for understanding how social entrepreneur’s childhood experiences and parental exposure to social entrepreneurship affect social entrepreneurial activity in adulthood. First, our results suggest that social entrepreneurs are imprinted by their childhood experiences but not by parental exposure to social entrepreneurship. Second, imprints tend to persist over time when they are linked to critical incidents regarding social entrepreneurship. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of imprinting mechanisms in social entrepreneurship contexts and highlight the importance of making examples of social entrepreneurship tangible to children. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={The forms and methods of financing are, in general, crucial for the development of social-enterprise initiatives. Social entrepreneurship is characterised by hybridity, which means that it relies on a resource mix including different types of financing: beyond market-based income, public funding stemming from international, national and/or local levels and different types of investments and donations are also important. International aid supported the re-emergence of civil society, which had been oppressed during state socialism. The methodological approach used in this study relied on desk research and country summaries. Desk research included a collection of secondary data based on available documents, reports, studies, strategies and other relevant documents regarding social entrepreneurship in the researched countries. In most of the countries studied, the first “footprints” of social enterprise can be found in state socialism, in the form of cooperatives, or even long before that, during World War II, in the form of voluntary engagement and cooperatives. © 2021 Taylor & Francis.},

Using hand-collected data from a survey of 190 social enterprises in South Korea, we identify a reliable measure for the sustainability of competing logics. We also identify the factors associated with variation in a social enterprise’s capacity to sustain dual commitments to competing institutional logics. Using an imprinting perspective, we show that a social en-trepreneur’s non-profit experience has a curvilinear effect on the sustainability of competing logics. Moreover, the non-linear effect of a social entrepreneur’s non-profit experience on the sustainability of competing logics is less profound in social enterprises with a highly ambivalent founder. © 2021 by the authors.

Two parent companies— FuBon and ChinaTrust, both financial holding firms—and two franchises—FuBon Guardians and ChinaTrust Elephants—in the Chinese Professional Baseball League were the research elements in this study to ensure generalizability of the findings of this study. The participants of this study were 268 spectators of a FuBon Guardians game and 201 spectators of a ChinaTrust Elephants game. Structural equation modeling was used for data analysis. Results indicated that innovation and corporate social responsibility positively correlated with social entrepreneurship. Moreover, social en-trepreneurship was positively associated with affective commitment to the parent company and sports franchise. Finally, affective commitment to the parent company not only exerted a positive effect on the intention to purchase the products of the parent company but also promoted the intention to purchase licensed merchandise and attend games. Similarly, affective commitment to the sports franchise not only exerted a positive effect on the intention to purchase licensed merchandise and attend games but also promoted the intention to purchase the products of the parent company.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper is based on the findings from the GOOD Awaits Podcast, a series of interviews with pioneers and practitioners of regenerative tourism. The podcast was created as a platform for the collective discovery of a new way forward for tourism in the wake of COVID-19, and the series provides a detailed summary of the regenerative tourism movement in NZ. Findings: Through these interviews, a vision for a regenerative visitor economy in Aotearoa emerged. This new model is rooted in indigenous knowledge and living systems theory. It is a paradigm shift that allows us to see tourism as a living ecosystem and requires innovative economic models, such as social entrepreneurship, systems level changes to the way tourism operates and is governed, local tourism solutions with community thriving as the primary aim and much more collaboration both within tourism and across sectors. Originality/value: Regenerative tourism is an emerging model and one that is rapidly gaining traction in NZ and globally. The GOOD Awaits podcast is a unique, thoughtful and practical demonstration of what this model could look like in Aotearoa. It demonstrates the potential and feasibility of regenerative tourism practice, and the response has shown the desire for these conversations at a national and international scale. This paper is an accessible summary of the podcast's first season and has value for anyone interested in the regenerative tourism movement in Aotearoa. © 2021, Josie Major and Debbie Clarke.},

abstract={Purpose: Social entrepreneurship is gradually becoming a potent driving force for economic and social development in developing countries as a result of governance deficits. The purpose of this study is to examine the determinant factors of successful social entrepreneurship in the emerging circular economy of Lebanon. The objective extends to exploring the mediating role of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the success of social entrepreneurship in Lebanon. Design/methodology/approach: Using a cross-sectional survey design, the authors collected primary data from 389 social entrepreneurs through questionnaires in selected locations in Lebanon. The data collected were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The hypotheses were tested using linear regression and structural equation modeling (SEM) for predicting the impact of independent variable on the dependent variable. The validity, progressive and various models fits were tested using root mean square of approximation, root mean square of residuals, standard root mean square residuals, incremental fit index, fitness of the extracted and non-normal fit index. Findings: The SEM estimations reveal that three main factors determine the success of social entrepreneurs in Lebanon, namely, environmental factors, psychological factors and prior experience. Moreover, the results reveal that support of NGOs positively moderates the relationships between the success of social entrepreneurship and two different variables (psychological factors and environmental factors), but failed to moderate the relationships between success of social entrepreneurship and four variables (experience, education, leadership and founding team composition). Originality/value: The study contributes to the entrepreneurship and circular economy literature by explicating empirically the determinant factors of successful social entrepreneurship in Lebanon’s emerging circular economy. It also provides a fact-based social awareness on the role of local and international NGOs in supporting the social entrepreneurs in driving the idea of a circular economy. The study also validates multiple entrepreneurship theories. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Using Giddens’s structuration theory and empirical data from a study with social enterprise stakeholders, the article explores how social entrepreneurs and the structure co-create one another. We show that the development of the contemporary significance of social entrepreneurialism lies in a combination of complex context-specific structural forces and the activities of agents who initiate, demand, and impose change. Social entrepreneurs intentionally tackle social challenges, but their actions bring unintentional results, such as the transfer of state responsibilities onto communities. Direct outputs of their activities introduce indirect outcomes, bringing wider changes in culture and policy. The evolving nature of entrepreneurship and a number of factors that interplay in time and space, and enable and constrain social entrepreneurs, confirm the applicability of Giddens’s theory in the field of social entrepreneurship. The originality of this article derives from revealing mechanisms that enable social entrepreneurs to emerge and reasons for structural change. We also build a “co-creation model of structure and agency” that can be used to “engineer” the process of social entrepreneurship. © The Author(s) 2021.},

abstract={Social entrepreneurship (SE) is a recent phenomenon spreading around the world. It is of growing interest to scholars, and many papers are focused on this area. This paper aims at revealing factor that predict a student's intention to be social entrepreneurs in the future. A massive number of theories and past scholars have carried out studies on the factors influencing SE intention, which resulted in a list containing large volume of variables. There was a need to generalize factors that capable to form a universal SE intention model. This research utilizing the theory of planned behavior (TPB) as the theoretical foundation in SE intention context. It is confirmed that TPB is enriching the literature and growing the theoretical and methodological strength of SE intention contributions. Two-stages sampling technique involves 419 undergraduate students from public and private universities were selected as respondents, at the same time as information become amassed via surveys. The information become then analyzed via the use of AMOS software. The structural equation modelling (SEM) was executed to develop the measurement model. The results exhibit that goodness of fit, construct reliability, convergent validity and discriminant validity achieved the overall fitness threshold to model SE intention. This research contributes to shed light on the literature via examining the elements of TPB in SE intention formation; whilst offering several important implications from theoretical and methodological perspective. © 2021.

abstract={Purpose: Research on entrepreneurship toward poverty reduction has outlined how micro-level characteristics of entrepreneurs capture entrepreneurial opportunities in settings of poverty; however, little is known about the influence of previous military experience in this context. This paper investigates how previous military experience influences poverty-reduction entrepreneurship. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses data from two main sources. First, individual-level and firm-level information come from a nationwide survey of founders of private enterprises. Second, province-level information is taken from the Marketization Index and the China Statistics Yearbook. An analysis of the Logit moderation model renders strong support for our conjectures. Findings: Via novel integration of imprinting theory and research on previous military experience, we propose that entrepreneurs with previous military experience have a strong sense of self-sacrifice, and as a result, are better able to participate in poverty-reduction entrepreneurship. In addition, we build on the resource availability and stakeholder expectations arguments and predict that the main effect of previous military experience on poverty-reduction entrepreneurship will be strengthened by reduced corporate philanthropy and increased government intervention. Originality/value: Our study adds to the extant literature in the following ways. First, it enriches the literature on entrepreneurship toward poverty reduction. Second, it contributes to imprinting theory in the entrepreneurial field. Third, it adds knowledge to the social entrepreneurship literature. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Compassion is acknowledged as a key motivational source of prosocial opportunity recognition (OR). This study examines the underlying processes of different types of compassion that lead to prosocial OR interventions designed to solve or ameliorate social problems. Self-compassion is associated with intimate personal experiences of suffering and encompasses a desire to alleviate the distress of others based on common humanity, mental distance and mindfulness. Other-regarding compassion is associated with value structures and social awareness and is based on a desire to help the less fortunate. Using a life-story analyses of 27 Israeli social entrepreneurs, we identified two OR process mechanisms, reflexivity (identifying overlooked social problems) and imprinting (identifying a known social problem within the social context). The relationship between these two types of compassion are equifinal, that is, both can lead to prosocial OR; however, the mechanisms differ. We contribute to the literature by showing that compassion serves as an internal enabler based on both cognitive and affective motivations for prosocial OR. We introduce a theoretical perspective that establishes a process model for further research on the role of compassion in identifying and leading prosocial action. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={Purpose: Athletes are increasingly perceived as important drivers of entrepreneurship and social change. As a result, increasing research and activity has attempted to engage athletes in both entrepreneurship and social entrepreneurship. Against this backdrop, the authors aim to provide insights on how high-level athletes in Germany understand entrepreneurship and social entrepreneurship and their perceptions of (social) entrepreneurship as a potential career pathway. Design/methodology/approach: A survey was designed for athletes to assess their social entrepreneurship-related skills and attitudes. This survey is based on Capella Peris et al. (2020) who developed and validated a social entrepreneurship questionnaire for use in the physical education sector. To deepen the authors’ understanding of the initial survey results, a structured focus group was conducted with an additional set of five high-level German athletes. Findings: Both the survey results and the focus group indicate that athletes have reservations about starting businesses or social enterprises, and that formal support on the topic is limited. Research limitations/implications: This paper suggests numerous possible avenues for future research, both related to athletes and sport social entrepreneurship more generally. The authors also suggest that athlete career programmes need to provide more support for athletes who wish to venture in entrepreneurial activities. Originality/value: This study answers numerous calls within sport entrepreneurship literature to further integrate athletes into research in the area. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The opportunity nexus in social entrepreneurship and our propositions highlight the role and nature of passion when mission-driven social entrepreneurs are trying to secure funding from angel investors. To develop propositions, we build on previous studies in social entrepreneurship, business angel funding, and entrepreneurial passion complemented with qualitative data from eight field interviews.

This research and design study referred to design-based research (DBR) and data was gathered by distributing questionnaires and conducting interviews to develop quality recommendations for revising products from validators and trial courses. Respondents were the students of Sanata Dharma University, Indonesia, and the validators were the learning design experts from the State University of Malang, Indonesia. The data was a descriptive elaboration of the validation stage and trials before and after the product prototype revision. Based on factual model analysis, it was found that the recent entrepreneurship learning practice had not yet enhanced the students’ spirit of entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial intention. The entrepreneurship learning material had not been linked systematically to the concepts of caring economics, which align with the spirit of mutual cooperation and togetherness. The validation and learning design prototype trials result was very beneficial and is ready to be implemented in the entrepreneurship learning class at a higher education level.

abstract={We analyze the interrelationships among entrepreneurship, innovation and the creative economy. Ordinarily the word ‘entrepreneurship’ implies financial (or commercial) enterprise undertaken with a profit motive whereas the phrase ‘social entrepreneurship’ implies, on average, a non-profit activity undertaken to improve a particular societal unfavourable condition or ill. The word ‘innovation’ implies an improved or new idea, product, production technology or any one of the myriad of business processes. The word ‘creative’ is perhaps the most nebulous and accommodates a variety of meanings. In finance and economics, however, the word ‘creative’ imparts a specific meaning in the sense of knowledge-based and traditional artisan-based craft products and services. We use a sample of 160 countries of the world for an empirical examination of the relationships among these three concepts. The results demonstrate that social entrepreneurship and the creative economy vary systematically across the sample countries and they are positively associated. In two subsamples, the creative economy is positively associated with the rule-of-law and market-size. The results explain more than three-quarters of the variability in the creative economy and suggest that the creative economy can change and develop over time as societies build the institutions for fostering social entrepreneurship and social innovation. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Purpose: Drawing on the resource-based view (RBV) and literature on relational embeddedness and network ties, we examine how personal relationships of international social entrepreneurs and accountability of social enterprises influence social value creation in cause-related marketing (CRM) of three UK-based international charities. The study also explores how personal relationships of international social entrepreneurs affect accountability of social entrepreneurship for social value creation of non-profit organizations in the UK context. Design/methodology/approach: Our research aimed to inform international social entrepreneurship literature by exploring the impact of personal relationships on accountability and social value creation processes via cause-related marketing (CRM) practices using a case study method. The lack of clearly defined social value creation in social entrepreneurship, and somewhat intangible processes of relationally embedded ties, accountability, and their impact, the case study method is most suited for this study. In particular, inquiry-based investigation surrounding social value, embedded ties and accountability requires systematic and structured dissemination to capture latent constructs. Findings: The findings show the importance of personal ties in the alignment of social mission with corporate social responsibility between UK-based international charities and commercial organizations across borders. In international social entrepreneurship, social value creation is facilitated by accountability of social goals while trust-based personal relationships assist access to commercial opportunities. Research limitations/implications: Further research could examine the role of trust in creating greater social value from an international social entrepreneurial perspective rather than from a solely non-profit social mission. It can also consider additional factors such as gender and cultural capital issues to investigate the role of personal relationships of international social entrepreneurs in the accountability and social value creation of non-profit organizations. Practical implications: The need to fulfil social objectives, missions and obligations are central to the involvement of international social entrepreneurs in CRM activities with commercial organizations. Accountability through clear communications serves as the basis for brokering new ties or partnerships within the social relations of entrepreneurs, particularly weak ties rendering trust for third party endorsement and sharing of information. Although partnerships with commercial organizations may create social value in CRM, the reliance on personal relationships may expose international social entrepreneurs to unethical practice beyond immediate relationships and/or opportunistic behavior without formal contracting mechanisms. International social entrepreneurs must therefore match the core values of their social mission with potential partners in their CRM engagements. Originality/value: The literature on international social entrepreneurship has not considered how social entrepreneurs' personal relationships at the individual level may impact accountability of social entrepreneurship for CRM and social value creation. This study builds on these studies by examining how individual level personal relationships of international social entrepreneurs with external stakeholders influence accountability of social entrepreneurship for CRM and social value creation at the organizational level. This study also builds on prior studies about entrepreneurial networks and network ties by examining the processes in which international social entrepreneurs use their personal relationships to access and utilize external resources for social value creation in CRM. Finally, this study contributes to previous research which provides limited insights into the international social entrepreneurship among organizations with reference to CRM where social value attributes are evaluated by embedded relational ties. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Case overview/synopsis: Kaarvan Crafts Foundation (referred to as Kaarvan henceforth) worked for women empowerment in Pakistan with a focus on creating economic opportunities for rural women entrepreneurs. The case shares different initiatives by Kaarvan for creating opportunities for economic empowerment of rural women entrepreneurs. The main focus of the case is a program “Digitize to Equalize” in which Kaarvan offered digital literacy training to rural women entrepreneurs. The program involved developing an ecommerce platform where rural women entrepreneurs could sell their handicrafts and other products. A comprehensive training activity was designed as part of the program to facilitate trainees to sell their products on a purpose-built website. The training covered different activities ranging from using smartphones, basic product photography to order handling. Even in the initial phase, the challenges were somewhat unexpected for the team as they grappled with diversity of learning among the trainees. Few trainee women were able to learn the skills quickly and requested their trainers from Kaarvan to train them on widely popular skills of social media marketing. At the same time, other trainees were struggling with basic skills and needed more time to get basics right. Because the program had limited resources, Kaarvan’s management found themselves in a fix. The mission-oriented organization wanted to ensure the best possible opportunities for the trainees but the resources did not permit to create separate cohorts for different training areas.

abstract={This study examines the process of knowledge transfer between a pair of social enterprises, organizations that are embedded in competing social and economic logics. Drawing on a longitudinal case study of the interaction between social enterprises operating in emerging economy settings, it uncovers factors which influence the transfer of a social innovation from a dense, population-rich setting to one where beneficiaries are geographically dispersed and the costs of service delivery are correspondingly elevated. Evidence from the case study suggests that institutional bricolage—the crafting of improvised solutions in resource-constrained settings—can serve as potent driving force in driving innovation transfer, and that this process of re-combining available resources may be facilitated by the extent to which the values between partner social enterprises are aligned. With such alignment, social enterprise partners may be able to increase trust, develop a smoother knowledge-transfer process, and find practical solutions which facilitate the transfer of life-enhancing social innovations to neglected rural settings. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={In the last decade, a global interest in impact investing—whose goal is to generate social and environmental benefits alongside economic returns—has rapidly grown. In this context, this paper explores the socio-demographic characteristics of investors who choose impact investment options over traditional investments, and on the drivers promoting such choices. More specifically, the study consists of an experiment-based research in which 602 participants (non-experts and experts in the financial sector) took part in a multiple-choice game involving different investment scenarios and incentive conditions. The findings show that both expert investors and female participants are more likely to choose impact investment options and that the tendency to invest in social funds increases with age. Neither external and centrally planned incentives, such as fiscal incentives, nor the educational level of participants show a significant influence on investment choices. By contrast, information about the actual social impact achieved by funds plays a role in promoting socially oriented decisions. In this regard, visual aids appear to be an effective means of promoting impact investment. These findings may be of interest to policymakers, social campaigners and investment practitioners themselves when designing strategies for raising interest in impact investing or norms to strengthen a conducive and enabling environment for social entrepreneurship more broadly. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={The purpose of this study was to determine the social engagement network in Sido Muncul’s CSR, the partnership program with farmers, and how the implementation of corporate social entrepreneurship in the program is carried out. The research design uses qualitative methods with a grounded theory approach that tests the validity and reliability of the data using triangulation of data sources and methods, namely, data obtained through documentation and the results of surveys and interviews to more than one observation unit. Data was obtained from surveys and interviews with Sido Muncul’s Public Relations and CSR Division, as well as partner farmers. The results of this study indicate that the social engagement network in Sido Muncul’s partnership program is related to the role of farmer groups, farmer cooperatives, government, NGOs, universities, and private companies as facilitators and control functions, thus creating mutually beneficial relationships with one another. The process of implementing corporate social entrepreneurship in Sido Muncul’s CSR for the partnership program with farmers consists of nine stages: problem identification, coordination with related parties, allocation of resources and commitments, collaboration with NGOs, local entrepreneurs and government, social innovation and the creation of new businesses, documentation of activities, reporting, monitoring and evaluation, as well as publications. © Copyright: The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.},

abstract={The present Special Issue focuses benefit corporation and social intrapreneurship as two topics which in the last decades have taken on a growing role in studies about both management and economics. This growing interest comes from globalization and digitization phenomena that have determined a change in firms’ stakeholders expectations. In this regard, social pressures about the behavior of companies have determined a new way of conceiving profit seen not only as shareholder remuneration but also as a direct or indirect tool to foster greater interdependence between economic activities and social objectives. For instance, the relationship between profit and sustainability no longer follows dichotomous logic. The firms are moving towards a path of socialization essential for their survival. The issue of sustainability, which previously appeared secondary in business economics studies, today is a pure necessity; the current competitive dimensions are based on intense and continuous engagement actions towards all stakeholders. This perspective is reflected in new theoretical strands such as the Social Emotional Wealth Theory, in which profit in the short run assumes secondary positions with respect to the survival not only of the company, but also of its founder, who tends to link its “immortality” to his/her firm. Thus, issues related to the sustainability are entering more and more the DNA of the firms on the one hand and economic policies are increasingly interested in the global aspects of sustainability (social, economic, environmental and governance) on the other hand. These trends have favored the development of new types of businesses, such as benefit corporation and start-ups related to the social entrepreneurship logic, committed to combining long-term profitability with certain standards and optimizing their positive impact on employees, the community in which they operate and the environment as well. The current economic crisis caused by Covid-19 seems to have accelerated this tendency to combine economic and social benefits. © 2020 De Gruyter. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Social entrepreneurship (SE) has gained prominence in recent years, becoming a primary field of study and providing rich research opportunities that are both challenging and intriguing. This paper seeks to fill the knowledge gap in this field by improving the understanding of business models of SE and, more specifically, investigating how social entrepreneurs design their business models in order to create both social and economic value. Using the abductive approach method, the paper explores a single case study that enquires about the business model of the social enterprise named "La Paranza Cooperative", located in southern Italy and operating in the cultural heritage industry. Our main theoretical contribution lies in illustrating and formalising the ambidexterity perspective through which social enterprises simultaneously pursue goals that are apparently contradictory, such as economic and social ones. Furthermore, on the practical side, we assess the win-win managerial mechanisms that benefit social enterprises through their external environment as a bundle of distinctive resources while contributing to its requalification. Finally, our explorative study opens-up for deeper and more detailed future research on the business model of SE. © 2020 De Gruyter. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Sustainable development is now seen as the business paradigm for the 21st century and poses a significant dilemma for managers, which is to balance economic goals, environmental impact and social development. In recent years, more and more attention has been paid to sustainable entrepreneurship as a concept combining triple bottom line (TBL) aspects since introducing social and ecological values and goals, in addition to economic ones, is seen as a long-term strategy for survival and value creation. Italy's socio-economic context where there are a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and social enterprises has proven to be a good field for new hybrid forms of forpurpose business. This paper is a single case in-depth study conducted over three years (2017-2019) analyzing Mondora, a certified and legally recognized Benefit Corporation that has introduced full-spectrum teal practices in its governance structure and is shifting the paradigm as a flourishing enterprise. The aim of this paper is to analyze the legal and governance framework of Mondora as a benefit corporation and delineate a best-case example that embraces new leadership practices as a pilot for future research on benefit corporations. The implications lie in the fact that the typology of the social entrepreneur present in benefit corporations has the characteristics of the quantum leader outlined by Tsao and Laszlo (2019). © 2020 De Gruyter.

abstract={The theory of conscious capitalism is based on the idea that when business is done consciously, it promotes humanity intrinsically. This philosophy is rooted in the four tenets of higher purpose, stakeholder integration, conscious leadership and conscious culture and management as given by Mackey and Sisodia (2013). All social entrepreneurs are motivated by a higher purpose to provide sustainable solutions to neglected problems with the help of positive externalities (Santos, 2012). They have the capacity to envision, share and execute the deep-seated higher purpose (Mourkogiannis, 2006). Such a higher purpose with a social angle has been depicted in the case of Vyomini. The case is about a social entrepreneur Prachi Kaushik, the founder of Vyomini. She works for menstrual health and hygiene of unprivileged and rural women in India. Prachi’s constant endeavour was to create an ecosystem for the economic and social upliftment of these women through financial inclusion and livelihood training. She understood the problem, empathized with the women and provided a simple, economical manufacturing technique using locally available, biodegradable raw materials to provide an inclusive solution. This case describes her journey in creating an innovative business model by the adoption of design thinking and implementation of higher purpose in the business. Dilemma: For ensuring menstrual health and hygiene among less privileged rural women should the sanitary napkins of big brands be distributed at a subsidized cost or design and develop a special product suitable for this segment of the market? Theory: Entrepreneurial inclusive business model Type of the case: Experience-based applied single case study Protagonist: The owner of the firm Options: Distribute existing brands at a subsidized cost. Develop a new product that is biodegradable, free of carcinogenic compounds and cost-effective. Get it manufactured by subcontractors. The design also a cost-effective manufacturing process and empower women of less privileged background to manufacture and sell. Discussions and Case Questions: How can the sources of supply and manufacturing be made robust so that they can be scaled up? Should the product be offered to different segments of the market with differential pricing? In order to expand reach, which channels should be added for a taboo product like sanitary napkins? © 2020 SAGE Publications.},

How do lesbians build networks and safe space under these conditions? How do they balance competing needs for visibility and safety? Drawing on 16 months of participant observation and ethnographic interviews, I analyze the relationship between lesbian community growth and safety practices. My intersectional approach examines the heterosexist context in which lesbian social spaces are maintained, and relations of power among LGBTQ, feminist, and anti-LGBTQ groups. Under threat of intersectional violence, lesbian social entrepreneurs withhold information, screen members and rely on spatial tactics to hide in plain sight, prioritizing safety over visibility. Finally, I discuss how some community members marginalized by these safety practices gain access to lesbian spaces. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Purpose: This paper aims to explore the social entrepreneurs’ attention allocation and their resource action that lead to hybrid organization using the paradox theory. Paradox theory deepens understandings of the varied nature, dynamics and outcomes of entrepreneurial tensions. This study explores the systematic effects of internal and external attention on both economic and social performance. Design/methodology/approach: First, theoretically, hypotheses linking different attention allocations to ambidextrous behavior and entrepreneurial performance were formulated. Subsequently, the empirical studies based on Chinese social entrepreneurship were conducted to test the hypotheses. Findings: The study provides support to the hypotheses showing that external attention is linked to resource acquisition and social performance, while internal attention is linked to resource acquisition and strategic human resource management and thus these ambidextrous behaviors promote both social and economic performance. Furthermore, normal pressure moderates the relations between internal attention and strategic human resource management only. Research limitations/implications: The research measures entrepreneurs’ attention with questionnaire rather than psych test. Also, static data rather than longitudinal research is designed to test the hypotheses. Practical implications: Deeper understanding of the attention of social entrepreneurs and resource action can help entrepreneurial outcomes and can potentially contribute to paradox and tension management by entrepreneurial practitioners in China. Originality/value: Social entrepreneurs’ different attention allocation and related entrepreneurial ambidextrous behavior processes are linked to paradoxical thinking for the first time. The findings of this research can potentially enhance social entrepreneurship paradoxical thinking aimed at preventing mission drift. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The aim of the article is to analyze public policies of social entrepreneurship in Slovenia and their developmental phases, the characteristics of social economy organizations, and to assess the framework conditions for social entrepre-neurship by social enterprises. Since social en-trepreneurship follows mainly social objectives, it needs the support of the ecosystem to develop properly. The EU allows the Member States to regulate social entrepreneurship itself, so Slovenia has formalized the social entrepreneurship domain through national-level legislation. In the article, a combination of quantitative and quali-tative methods is applied, using primary data on social enterprises and a case study approach. The results of the analysis of social economy organizations in Slovenia indicate that the for-mal status of social enterprises covers a wide range of organizations and their share is low in the national context. The analysis of the case study organizations indicates that the legislation is considered as the main factor hindering the development of social entrepreneurship. Moreover, their assessment of public policies is rather judg-mental and disapproving. In general, the results reveal that although the area of social entrepre-neurship in Slovenia is developing, a vision and long-term strategy is still lacking and the implementation of supportive environment incentives is insufficient. © 2020, Universitatea Babes-Bolyai.

abstract={Increasing the level of entrepreneurial activity is determined by the extent to which its development is necessary to form a sustainable functioning of the region or the country as a whole. The relevance of the study is determined by the fact that the formation of entrepreneurial activity at the moment occurs only where there is a basis for social interaction between the subjects of entrepreneurship and society. The novelty of the study is determined by the fact that the paper uses a cluster approach, which allows to distinguish level estimates of the conditions of development of entrepreneurial activity. The author shows that the conditions for social interaction are the driver for development in the conditions of increasing the level of individualisation of social interaction. The article shows that social conditions determine the development of a new form of standardisation of entrepreneurship in the form of social entrepreneurship. The author demonstrates the mechanism of development of social entrepreneurship and the possibilities of its implementation both in the conditions of the innovative market and in the structure of stagnant market tendencies. The practical significance of the study is that social entrepreneurship is determined by the need to differentiate the conditions of its development and when forming cross-border clusters allows to predict and implement regional programs for the development of entrepreneurial activity. © 2020, by ASERS® Publishing.},

abstract={This article outlines the grassroot level work of Project Sakhi which creates awareness about menstrual hygiene and has set up self-sustaining production units of low-cost sanitary napkins in rural India. The first section of the article focuses on project Sakhi: its genesis, organizational dynamics, and the complementary use of traditional methods such as folk songs and the modern social media marketing strategies to sustain the project. The eco-friendly incinerator–Ashuddhinashak designed by the founder is illustrated. The second section of this paper focuses on an understanding of the founders’ perspectives in the context of the challenges they faced working in interior rural India and the perspectives of the key stakeholders such as the women employees, adolescent school girls, and an associated NGO worker. The impact of the project has been discussed in the context of five aspects: health, employment, revenue generation, environmental considerations, and sustainability of the model in the Indian context. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to add to the existing wealth of knowledge on the benefits and challenges of social entrepreneurship in Egypt, a challenging emerging economy. Design/methodology/approach: The research combines secondary and primary research with the latter including interviews across the public, private and social entrepreneurship sectors, together with surveys to gather Egyptian and international perspectives. Findings: The study addresses several political, cultural and economic themes that significantly influence the emergence and growth of social entrepreneurship organisations in Egypt. Research limitations/implications: Egypt is undergoing significant change at present; hence, this research provides a snapshot of what may be considered a very dynamic environment. Practical implications: Recommendations are made that have practical implications for each of the public, private, development and non-profit sectors in Egypt. It is suggested that the public sector ought to unite its efforts under one umbrella organisation, the private sector could benefit from growing social awareness across the region, while development groups should continue to focus on education generally. Non-profit entities can seek to collaborate with others, and all organisations can make better use of developing global communications technology. Social implications: A base of social entrepreneurship is already established in Egypt, but this research suggests that further encouragement of these initiatives could help develop the economy and foster a more socially aware culture and political landscape. Originality/value: Social entrepreneurship in Egypt continues to evolve, and this research identifies a number of economic, cultural and political perspectives that, if addressed, could help accelerate progress. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to identify the entrepreneurial intention (EI) among nascent entrepreneurs in the Indian context by using Shapero’s theory of entrepreneurial event as the research framework. Design/methodology/approach: A 34-item questionnaire was responded to 250 nascent entrepreneurs who are engaged in executing the new business idea or creating new ventures and enroled in the universities in India. The questions measured perceived desirability, perceived feasibility, entrepreneurial educational background, entrepreneurial self-efficacy, perceived social pressure and previous work experience in entrepreneurial activities towards entrepreneurship intention. The data were collected by employing a systematic random sampling method. The sample represents 174 male and 76 female nascent entrepreneurs belonging to various disciplines. Structural equation modelling has been used for data analysis. Findings: The results show that the proposed model in the present study explains 51 per cent of the variance, explaining the entrepreneurship intention. Entrepreneurial self-efficacy was found to be the strongest predictor of EI (β=0.397 at p<0.001) followed by previous experience in entrepreneurial activities (β=0.285 at p<0.001). Research limitations/implications: More than limitation this research study adds to the existing literature of the EI by using a different set of the sample. Mostly EI studies used student sample to measure intentions. Kolvereid and Isaksen used a sample of entrepreneurs to measure EI and achieved very different results. Therefore, this research study extends the work of Kolvereid and Isaksen by using a sample of nascent social entrepreneurs. Practical implications: The finding of this research study will facilitate policy makers and educators to promote entrepreneurial activities at the university level. Based on the results and findings of the study, the educators may improve upon the support system to help and motivate students to opt for social entrepreneurship as their career choice. Originality/value: Ajzen (1988) emphasised that the relative significance of the antecedents of intention will vary depending on which stage of intention is under scrutiny. This is one of its kinds of research study that used a sample of nascent entrepreneurs in the Indian context. Findings of this research will be helpful in predicting how the intention process of nascent entrepreneurs works especially in developing countries. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

We analyse how such ethical judgments emerged using data gathered over a 4 year period in Maputo. Our findings illustrate three modes used to inform ethical judgments: embracing, rejecting and integrating. These describe how ethical judgments transpire as participants evaluate social entrepreneurship drawing upon related global normative meanings and those embedded within the local context. This analysis offers a critical contribution regarding how ethical judgments regarding social entrepreneurship evolve from negotiation and interaction within a context of multiple spatio-cultural meanings. © 2019, The Author(s).},

abstract={This paper investigates the required elements in the advancement of social innovation (SI) produced by entrepreneurial organisations. These efforts are to assist the establishment of a new conceptual framework including the voices of those, most vulnerable and ferociously impacted by not only local but also global crisis. Qualitative data by an organisation which educates social workers and refugees fuel the concept of social innovation by pointing to the interplay of structure and agency as well as social issues and impact on economy. Our existing knowledge on the role of social enterprises and refugee support through social innovative services are limited. Social innovation is closely linked to social entrepreneurship (SE) in practice and in literature. SE in context of refugee support is a concept currently gaining attention. Social innovation could be equally relevant in this regard. SI is a broad, versatile term, believed to hold a yet fully to be discovered potential. While SI is not a new revelation it is, however contested as a term and is yet to be fully understood, defined and diffused for it to be exploited at its maximum potential. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Today we face many societal problems, such as climate degradation, energy shortages, increasing inequality, and demographic change. Solutions for these problems require far-reaching changes and new and untried approaches. Social Innovation (SI) could be a significant factor in tackling the challenges to come. The ‘reflection on the long-term effects of social innovations’ is a relatively new topic but is attracting growing interest. While technology assessments are regularly used to study the consequences of technical innovations, similar assessments for social innovations are rare. This paper explores and analyses the current state of theoretical, conceptual work on the assessment for SI and their consequences, related concepts, and relevant activities. Perspectives and options for further developments in this field are derived. The method used is a structured literature review. The results show that scientific research concerning the assessment of the consequences of social innovations seems to be still in its infancy. The boundaries between established topics (such as sustainability, user orientation, including social entrepreneurship) and newer concepts are fluid. However, alongside the different approaches and views, a certain convergence of perspectives with regard to the consequences and effects of (social) innovations can be observed. Similar questions and issues are dealt with using similar approaches and methods, and are sometimes confronted with similar obstacles. © Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).},

Building on theories of individual imprinting, we theorize that the commercialization of social ventures is influenced by two types of commercial experience: parental imprinting from the commercial work experience of a founder’s parents, and work imprinting from a founder’s professional experience within for-profit organizations. We find support for our theory based on analysis of a novel dataset of over 2,000 nascent social ventures and their founders. We further find that the marginal effects of additional work imprinting from a founder’s commercial experience decline with the longevity of this experience. We discuss implications of our findings for literatures on social ventures, imprinting, and hybrid organizations. © 2020 by Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The present research aims to examine the entrepreneurial profiles of Turkish entrepreneurs and its relation between motivational persistence and intolerance to uncertainty. However, there are previous studies that focus on Commercial, Social and Strategic Entrepreneurship, no such study has examined all three profiles at the same time. For this reason, it is considered necessary to develop a valid and reliable scale to measure for those entrepreneurial profiles. The relevant literature has been collected to this study. Furthermore, The methodology of the study adopts a scale of 30 items. The participants of the research constitute a total of 298 Turkish entrepreneurs. Exploratory factor analysis, Confirmatory factor analysis and Reliability analysis are used to examine the structure of the scale. Pearson Correlation Analysis and Hierarchical Linear Regression Analysis are used to test the hypotheses of the study. Through the results of exploratory factor analysis, a construct with 26 items and 3 factors, named as “Commercial Entrepreneurs”, “Social Entrepreneurs” and “Strategic Entrepreneurs”, have been achieved according to scope of the study. It is revealed that the Commercial Entrepreneurship profile is not predicted by intolerance to uncertainty. However, it has been determined that the profile of Social Entrepreneurship and Strategic Entrepreneurship is predicted by both motivational persistence and intolerance to uncertainty. Besides, it has been determined that most of the individuals show the characteristics of Strategic Entrepreneurship (n = 214), Social Entrepreneurship (n = 49) and Commercial Entrepreneurship (n = 35). © 2020, Czestochowa University of Technology.

abstract={Social entrepreneurship (SE) had been introduced in the university as one of the efforts to nurture future social entrepreneurs. SE courses established at the university level with a combination of cooperation from the local community and industry give a more effective impact on the local community. The knowledge and skills taught from universities regardless of the academic or cultural background can be used to balance the social problems in the community with the development of social innovation to solve the issues. However, several challenges delayed further development of a successful SE programme in higher education. This research employs the systematic literature review (SLR) which utilizes in-depth and absolute evaluation of related literature on the research topic. Four challenges have been encountered include; the design of SE curricula, financial and funding problems, lack of professionals to teach SE courses, and prohibitive social and university environment issues. This research has also suggested some best practices include; more SE awareness programmes, university management in solving funding problems, preparing SE coaching professionals, and setting up more university-industry collaborations. This paper proposes suggestions to counter the challenges and leverage the social network as an innovative technological alternative and giving more opportunities for improved social benefits. © 2020 National Institute of Education, Singapore.},

abstract={Social entrepreneurship is considered as a solution in reducing unemployment and poverty. Social entrepreneurs in this study are called as sociopreneurs. This study aims to identify the social characters as predictors of sociopreneurs’ motivation in Bandung, Indonesia. In addition, this study also explores more deeply how sociopreneurs prioritise social values, and the impact of becoming sociopreneurs. This study attempts to overcome gaps in understanding social entrepreneurship broadly by taking the perspective of social-oriented, using qualitative methods and a case study approach. Empirical data is collected by conducting in-depth semi-structured interviews with sociopreneurs in Bandung as respondents in this study. This study identifies several social entrepreneurship values which include social values, civil society, innovation, economic activities, and social impacts (outcomes). In addition, personal values influence the creation of social enterprises through the values of personal experience, the desire to make changes and the willingness to do something meaningful in one’s life.

abstract={Social innovation is a significant change that occurs in a society. This change is normally done via the creation of a new venture to solve social problems, i.e., social entrepreneurship. However, less is known about social innovations promoted within an existing organisational setting, i.e., social intrapreneurship especially within a developing country. The paper analyses the case of a social intrapreneur who developed an innovative idea during the 2014 Ebola crisis in Sierra Leone. Through the insights obtained, we were able to develop and elaborate on a five-staged model for social innovation and focused on two relevant aspects in social intrapreneurship: internal governance process and external legitimisation and support.

On the other hand, social entrepreneurship is a relatively new phenomenon established in this century. The aim of this paper is to assess the trends and challenges of social economy development in Croatia as the newest, last EU member state. On the basis of a secondary data analysis, the paper scrutinizes trends in social economy development. Social entrepreneurship is analysed as a part of the social economy that is strengthening, as well as the economic activity of associations that tends to turn into a social economy or a solidarity economy. The paper will also give an overview of the instances of the institutional context of the development of cooperatives and social enterprises, such as the recent legislative and policy changes, as well as the institutional framework with some insights into recommendations how to promote the development of the social economy sector in Croatia. © 2020, Editura Academiei Romane.

abstract={This paper examines rural social entrepreneurship program in rural Malaysia communities. The program seeks to promote and turn rural entrepreneurs into social entrepreneurs by strengthening their economic activities and enhancing social capital. This paper focuses on a component of the rural entrepreneur program (REP), namely the Social Entrepreneur Club (SEC). The club runs the rural entrepreneur program and upholds the program’s objectives. It promotes the socialization of rural communities by engaging them in entrepreneurial activities. The club operates under the Rural Internet Centre (RIC); a telecentre that provides space for rural communities to enhance their ICT knowledge and skills. However, despite the opportunity provided, some of the rural entrepreneurs do not show adequate interest in the program as they prefer being entrepreneurs, but not social entrepreneurs. Thus, the success of the SECs depends on the entrepreneurs’ participation in the program, the geographical locations and the support from the telecentre managers. This paper employs the economic gardening concept and community informatics approach to empirically gather evidence to test the theory on ICT for development; particularly rural development for rural communities. A quantitative method has been used to measure the implications of ICT in this program. Data from the entrepreneurs is obtained through an online survey which has been conducted across the varying regions in Malaysia. The quantitative data is supported by interviews (qualitative method) with telecentre managers. The primary data has been triangulated to analyze the results. The key findings show that the SEC is seen as economic development strategy by creating jobs, as well as increasing income and business opportunities. It also strengthens social networking needed to build social capital within and outside of the rural communities. Hence SEC is also a community connector and can be used as an indicator on the quality of rural communities’ wellbeing. © 2020, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Facilitating entrepreneurship through micro-credit, micro-franchise, and micro-consignment potentially helps to alleviate desperate poverty. However, the effectiveness of these facilitators have varied from positive outcomes of poverty alleviation to negative outcomes of increased debt. Therefore, we seek to understand: how and why are different facilitators of entrepreneurial activity at the Base of the Pyramid (BOP) relatively more effective at alleviating poverty? Building on the foundation of person-entrepreneurship fit, we introduce the construct of person-facilitator fit and develop propositions about how and why the fit between entrepreneurs and the different facilitators of entrepreneurship may influence poverty alleviation. Specifically, using a remediation perspective, we explicate how the demands-abilities and needs-supplies fit between an entrepreneur and the different facilitators of micro-credit, micro-franchise and micro-consignment moderates the likelihood of poverty alleviation and how person-facilitator fit moderates the magnitude of poverty alleviation over time. We offer theoretical and practical implications of our framework for different perspectives (remediation, reform, and revolution) on entrepreneurship and poverty alleviation. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Social entrepreneurship (SE) has become a global phenomenon that is increasingly receiving institutional support as a business model designed to address social problems. However, despite having a global presence, enthusiasm for SE has run ahead of its scientific enquiry. As the field is still developing, the empirical nature of SE research has become a major cause for concern. Consequently, the target for this current study was twofold: Firstly, to propose and validate a scale to measure social entrepreneurial intention bias (SEI-Bias) using a German and a South African sample of university students (N total=595). Secondly, to identify patterns of social entrepreneurial antecedents among people with a high SEI-Bias compared to people with a low SEI-Bias. Applying exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, and correlation analysis, to develop and validate a robust SE intention bias scale comprising of three Reductive Bias (RB)-facets. Furthermore, based on a rather low or high level of each of the three RB-facets, significant differences were found in the level to which RB influences SE intention. Additionally, an outline of the implications and limitations of our findings as well as recommendations for future practice were made. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

An inductive, interpretivist approach has been used for drawing propositions. Through six propositions, the article understands the phenomenon of social innovation, the barriers and bottlenecks in the same which ultimately has to lead to higher levels of social impact and SVC resulting in a win-win-win situation for all the stakeholders. The biggest limitation is that it is difficult to generalise the phenomenon occurring in case of this case research, which may be exactly replicated in other organisational settings/situations/circumstances. The case study has been developed after having taken permission directly from the founder and co-founders of the enterprise.

To this end, an experimental survey was conducted with 222 participants. The results of a multivariate analysis of variance show that social enterprises are perceived as more socially responsible and credible than their traditional counterparts and face higher expectations in terms of sustainable behaviour. However, irresponsible behaviour was not found to yield stronger negative stakeholder reactions to social enterprises than to traditional enterprises. In addition, consumers' willingness to buy and willingness to pay for sustainable products were not higher for the products offered by social enterprises than by traditional enterprises. In sum, the study indicates that it is a difficult undertaking for social enterprises to successfully compete with their traditional counterparts in the market for sustainable products in the long run. © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={There are many educational reforms that have taken a turn in Nigeria but leadership and entrepreneurship skills have not received much attention in the reforms and curriculum development as a whole. However, there are limited research and model that create a platform for teenagers and youths to acquire leadership and entrepreneurial skills in public high schools. Previous work has only focused on students in tertiary institutions. In response to the need and to produce youths with entrepreneurial, leadership skills, competent and resilience, this paper investigates the impact of leadership and entrepreneurship education as a strategy for strengthening youth community engagement in Nigeria, lesson learnt from Jumpstart Project. The study adopted the theory of social impact assessment. The respondents are the final year and alumni scholars of the project. A qualitative design method was used. An interview was conducted containing some questions under these sub-themes the accessibility, types, relevant, how they utilized the skills learnt and the challenges faced during the project. An analysis from the responses indicated that leadership and entrepreneurial education is highly important for students in high schools where the students can align their education pursuit with leadership and entrepreneurial skills. However, there is a lot that is expected of them in order to meet up with the school curriculum. Furthermore, this study found a correlation between entrepreneurial and leadership education and academic excellence. The study recommends that such a model should be adopted into the curriculum, where all government-owned high school students learn the art of leadership and develop the entrepreneurial spirit even as a teenager. © 2019, Allied Business Academies.

abstract={Social enterprises are considered to be at the heart of inclusive growth due to their emphasis on people and social cohesion that help effect social and economic transformation. In the Tenth Malaysia Plan (2011–2015), two out of ten objectives are on achieving inclusive growth. In this context, this article explores the ecosystem for social enterprises in Malaysia, raising the following research questions: (a) what are the attributes (features) of business incubators (BIs) and intermediaries (IMs) operating in the social enterprise sector in Malaysia? (b) What are the perceptions of BIs and IMs on various aspects of the social enterprise ecosystem in Malaysia? (c) What is the role of BIs and other IMs in fostering social entrepreneurship (SE) in Malaysia in general and meeting the inclusive growth objective of the country in particular? This study employs the qualitative approach and primary data gathered through interviews of six BIs and IMs and twenty social enterprises. This study found that the current social enterprise ecosystem is weak and still emerging and has yet to take a concrete shape. The absence of legal status for social enterprise is the single most important obstacle in unlocking the potential growth of social enterprise sector. This study suggests that the government initiates policy measures to give legal status to social enterprises in the country, in order to develop the ecosystem and facilitate a greater participation of the private sector. © 2019 SAGE Publications.},

abstract={In this article, I lay out some ideas on developing resilient local water systems by drawing from fieldwork in the sanitation sector. Specifically, I examine how differing configurations of water resource ownership (municipality, private sector) and water system management (municipality, community, private sector) can help to construct models of water supply management that are resilient to both local and global shocks and which can inform the development of sustainable water supply systems in communities of different sizes and divergent endowments of water resources. In doing this, I attempt to link recent work on organizational resilience and social enterprise to the broader field of water resources ownership and management as seen from a development perspective. © 2018, AESS.},

abstract={In this article, we consider the status of social entrepreneurship and social enterprise in relation to government and public administration practice. For this purpose, we present and discuss a framework composed of three alignments. In the first alignment, social entrepreneurial practices and supportive policies, to the extent they exist, are fully bracketed within sociohistorical traditions of the place and cultural traditions of the people and groups in society. In the second alignment, governments have established or are in the process of establishing systems reforms to promote social entrepreneurial behavior that link specific policy interventions, or sociocultural interventions, with a normatively desired environment. This includes making system reforms that strive to break away from the historical and cultural biases that may have restrained social enterprises and in which legal, social, political, and economic interventions are fully aligned with one another. In the third alignment, the reforms designed and implemented are focused on the specific objectives that can enable and facilitate social entrepreneurial behavior like access to human and financial capital, access to markets for products and/or services developed, access to government decision makers who are responsible for establishing environments, and/or policies conducive to social entrepreneurial behavior and ventures. We selected three countries, United States, Switzerland, and Lithuania, as illustrations for our framework, given their highly divergent sociohistorical contexts, current governance structures, and comfort with various ideals and excesses of capitalist and social-democratic systems. This exploration gives the reader a foundational understanding of the concept and divergent approaches to implementation of a social-entrepreneurial cultural and policy framework. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Networks have been widely recognized as important to social entrepreneurship. This investigation aims to analyse how the structure of networks is influenced by the social organizations’ features and the entrepreneurs’ characteristics. After a review of pertinent literature on the topic, exploratory research is performed based on a quantitative approach. The primary data were collected through an online survey sent to Portuguese social organizations. The results confirm that networks have a substantial density in social entrepreneurship and that social organizations are surrounded either by strong or by weak ties. The investigation also reveals that networks’ formation is highly context-dependent, since its structure is influenced by the features of the social organization and the demographic and organizational status of its leaders. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Introduction. In modern society, the issue of solving social problems and reducing social tensions becomes urgent. These social aspects can be solved not only within the framework of the state policy but also through the organization of social activities. In this regard, it is necessary to consider the question of the effective functioning of social business structures. Research Methodology. Within the framework of this study, social entrepreneurship is viewed as an innovative activity united by the duality of goals-profit making and satisfaction of social needs, organized in the context of inclusive economy. Special attention is paid to the personal factor of a social entrepreneur, and the influence of this parameter on the organization of social business. The existing system of basic moral, psychological, personal and business qualities affects the activities of a traditional entrepreneur. On its basis, the system of additional qualities necessary for creating a social business was developed. Research Results. The interrelation of the main components of the concept of “social entrepreneurship” is shown. The expected results of the development of social entrepreneurship using the personal factor of a businessman in inclusive economy with specific proposals relevant to modern society are presented. Discussion. The study synthesizes scientific approaches of Russian and foreign authors in the field of social entrepreneurship, the prerequisites for the development of this activity and the impact of inclusive economy on modern society. Conclusion. Competent and rational use of the personal factor of a social entrepreneur in the context of inclusive economy will make social business activities more productive and efficient. © BEIESP.},

abstract={Purpose: Mainstream entrepreneurship research tends to adopt either the causation or effectuation perspective in their studies. Yet, the social enterprise literature has largely focussed on the bricolage perspective to explain social entrepreneurial action. The authors argue that when investigating legitimacy driven opportunity pursuit of an enterprise’s pre-emergence stage, all three perspectives of causation, effectuation and bricolage are required. The purpose of this paper was to address the research question how does effectuation determine entrepreneurial action in the pre-emergence of a social enterprise? Design/methodology/approach: An in-depth single case study approach was used based on the data provided by the founding entrepreneur of Good-Faith Learning social enterprise in Australia. Findings: The results demonstrated the complementary evolution of the three perspectives. In the following sequence, the effectuation, causation and bricolage actions were identified during the pre-emergence stage of the Good-Faith Learning social enterprise. Specifically, the input–process–output perspective of the study confirmed that the initial stage reflects on the effectual means linked to the causation-based strong articulation of the social vision and mission. The process stage dominates the bricolage approach to resourcing leading to effectual outcomes subsequently. Further, the specific actions of the pre-emergence stage are comprised legitimacy driven symbolic management approaches conveying the entrepreneur’s credibility and commitment, professional organising through website, gut-instinct based team selection, and organisational achievement. Research limitations/implications: The future research may conduct multiple case study analysis with multiple respondents to observe the consistency or deviations of the patterns identified in this study. Originality/value: This single case study demonstrates the complementary existence of causation, effectuation and bricolage elements in entrepreneurial actions in a single social enterprise context and advances the social entrepreneurship literature. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={This article contributes to research of vulnerable communities and investigates the role of social enterprise created or saved from closure by social entrepreneurs affected personally by a life-changing event, in the context of stroke survival. Qualitative research is deployed to investigate the ways in which social enterprise supports survivors of stroke and their caregivers. Research analysis identifies start-up motives and challenges faced by social entrepreneurs and highlights how social enterprise can bridge the gap in support provision provided by the statutory and third sectors. Involvement in stroke clubs was found to be a key positive contributor to participants’ life after stroke. This study has found that those who become social entrepreneurs after a life-changing event exhibit altruistic behaviours, while engagement between these social enterprises and this vulnerable group created specific benefits for vulnerable individuals and their caregivers, highlighting the potential for social enterprise to bridge the gap between statutory and third sectors which is currently overlooked in existing policy provision. The article concludes by making detailed recommendations for future research in this context and for governments and policymakers. © The Author(s) 2019.},

In light of this mixed historical record, this article explores the future of enlightened business leadership. It critically evaluates six trends that will greatly determine the extent to which corporate executives will introduce virtuous practices in the coming decade, including a new generation of enlightened capitalists, several consortia of socially progressive business leaders, the growth of social entrepreneurship, the emergence of benefit corporations, and changes in investor attitudes. © The Regents of the University of California 2019.},
